---
This is one of those incredibly useful must-have tools.  It's called a "spruce-cutter", but I have never used it to cut spruce.  In fact, I had to google 'spruce' because all I knew was it was some sort of tree-like plant.  I suspect this would be quiet useful for many things in the garden. I use mine for fine cutting of delicate, yet hard, materials, such small electrical components, model parts, vinyl threads, just about anything that's just a bit too much for common scissors.  It even works as a toenail cutter when your actual toenail cutter breaks, as mine seem to do a lot :/
