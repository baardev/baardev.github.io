intro: Perhaps the most versatile tool ever.
---
The hot glue gun is one of the most useful tools I have.  I use it to fix things, mold things, adjust clothing, fix my glasses and shoes, secure wires, and about 100 other things.

This particular model uses the thin glue stick, which is more convenient for smaller home jobs, heats faster and uses less energy.  Other models use a much thicker glue stick that works better for more heavy-duty tasks.
