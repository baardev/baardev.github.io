**Rule #1: It doesn’t matter.**

 One of USA Today’s Best Self-Help Books of the Year: “Hilarious.” —People

Prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt has commented on some of the most important trends and events of our time in insightful columns in Time and discerning commentaries on PBSNewshour with Jim Lehrer. But at the dawn of a new millennium, Roger found himself facing an issue that he couldn’t talk his way out of: getting old.

Luckily, aging couldn’t dull his wit, and he turned his sharp pen to creating a survival manual for the twilight of life. These fifty-four brilliant, funny, and indispensable rules range from how to handle a bad hair day (or a no hair day) to knowing the difference between humor and comedy to learning that, in the end, none of these little worries really matter. Practical, wise, and funny, Rules for Aging offers not only a new mantra for an older generation but “a guide for those in the younger generation who want to learn from the mistakes of their elders” (Newsday).
