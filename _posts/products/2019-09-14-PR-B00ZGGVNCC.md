This is a surprisingly useful and handy tool.  It slips into the latch on the car door and provides a sturdy handle to pull/push yourself out of your seat and for extra stability when stepping out fo the car onto snow or ice.  It's also a flashlight.  That little slit on the handle is also a window breaker, which seems kind of random, but, I suppose if you need to break your windows to get out of the car, it's pretty important.
