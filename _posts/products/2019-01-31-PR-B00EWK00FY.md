If you are going to get a pellet gun for self-defense (which many experts recommend against, and others recommend for.. do your research), this is a good option.  Velocity of 500+ fps penetrates 5-6â€³ of soft tissue, shoots 10-50 shots without reloading, CO<sub>2</sub> provides continuous shooting without cocking the action, no regulation or background checks, low noise so won't disturb neighbors or set off car alarms, no recoil or noise, accurate, lightweight and low cost.
