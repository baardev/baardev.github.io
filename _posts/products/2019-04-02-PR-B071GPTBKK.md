This is great for watching videos or looking at pictures.  Honestly, it is not so great for interacting with your phone, such as when reading email or surfing the web.  it work as shows, but you have to awkwardly move your hands around the screen to navigate.  

These screen magnifiers actually work pretty well.  Most are made with cheap plastic and can cost as little as a few bucks.  This is a bit higher quality.  You can see one in action here {% youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S6KwNqqdcI %}
