Make your own wine!  OK, you not goign to end up with a Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc 1947, but on the plus side, it will cost a lot less than $304,375 a bottle (more like $2).  This kit is a great place to start.  You'll also need a few extra items that you can easily get locally.  Homemade wine can be pretty good, and you don't need to use grapes.  You can use almost anything, even wood! So, go crazy!
