intro: Intricate model of the Swedish Wasa ship of 1628
---
Corel's Wasa kit accurately recreates every detail from the restoration plans. Over 350 sculptured parts of gilded metal provide ornamentation. Fittings are walnut, beech, copper, and brass. The 64 cannons aboard are machine turned brass. Hull is double-planked in basswood and walnut.

All structural parts of poplar, tanganyka and walnut are laser-cut for a perfect fit. Included are nine sheets of plans and step-by-step instructions.

You can tell this is not for beginners just by the price :/

The WASA, a royal Swedish vessel with 64 guns sank in the waters around Stockholm on the day it was launched (10 August 1628) as the result of a violent gust of wind. The ship settled in 35 m of water. Construction on the vessel started in 1625, under the direction of the Dutch architect Henrik Hybertsson. While some guns and a few other objects had been recovered earlier, it was only possible to bring the ship to the surface in 1956. Partially rebuilt and restored, the WASA was installed in the Wasa Museum in Stockholm in 1958. This reproduction of the WASA is based on the excellent design documents published by the Board of the Museum.</P>
