There are many electronic whistles out there today, but I always keep an old fashioned whistle available because I don't want to discover my batteries are dead, or it shorted out when I dropped it in the water, or any of the other dozen reasons electronic/digital stuff breaks.  Plus, as they are so inexpensive it is easy for me to hand them out to others who may need them in rural or urban settings.  Just like the electronic whistles, these alone should not be depended on for self-defense, although they do work most of the time on bears and other animals.
