intro: New pain relieving formulation with 100% "no questions asked" guarantee.
---
These Southern Californa chemists claim to have discovered a new formulation to relieve pain.  With over 2,000,000 client's, I suspect they might be on to something, and with a 100% money back "no questions asked" guarantee, they are pretty confident you'll agree.

This can be used when you feel pain, discomfort, tingling, or numbness including your back, neck, knee, hand, foot, etc, and can also be used with heating pads, ice packs, arthritis gloves, back pain massagers, tennis elbow straps, carpal tunnel braces, fibromyalgia supplements, neuropathy socks, sciatica cushions, tendonitis supports, bursitis braces, etc.

Their formulation includes arnica, glucosamine, MSM (DMSO2), choline, Boswellia Serrata & vitamin B6. It is also vanishing scent, made in the USA, non-greasy, non-staining, paraben-free, and NEVER tested on animals.
