intro: Can openers have come a long way since they were invented 200 years ago.

* Calling this can opener a "safety' lid opener seems like a bit of a stretch... I mean, not since the Bully Beef can opener of the mid 19th century has opening cans been a dangerous task.  Still, in the 200-year evolution of the can opener, this one is surely on the more evolved models.
* Safely and easily removes lids, leaving a smooth edge that is suitable for resealing with a plastic lid
* Blade made of stainless steel; ergonomic handle; dishwasher safe
* Great for resealing dog and cat food cans, or coffee cans
* Turn knob is comfortable to hold and turns easily; cuts from the side leaving the rim smooth, not sharp or jagged
* LidLifter jaws clamp on to remove lid from can and then releases into trash with a push of a button
