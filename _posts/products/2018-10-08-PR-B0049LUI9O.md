intro: Do yourself a favor while making the world less gross.

Ancient cave painting from 30,000 years ago depicts hairy raced people without beards.  Copper razors appeared in Egypt and India in 3,000 BC.  In short, the history of modern civilization is inextricably bound to grooming one's hair.  I am not sure when ear and nose hair trimming came into fashion but considering how much it says about a person with bushy ear and nose hair, I suspect it's been around for a while as well.  Support civilization.  Trim you nose and ear hairs!
