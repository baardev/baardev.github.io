It's All Too Much is Peterâ€™s proven system for anyone who wants to let go and escape the suffocating clutter in their lives. With his good humor and reassuring advice, Peter shows you how to face the really big question: What is the vision for the life you want to live? Through simple techniques and step-by-step plans, you can assess the state of your home, prioritize your possessions, and let go of the clutter you have been holding on to that has kept you from living the life you imagine. Going way beyond color-coded boxes and storage bin solutions, It's All Too Much shows you how to honestly determine what adds to your quality of life and what\'s keeping you from living the life of your dreams. The result is freed-up space, less stress, and more energy for living a happier, richer life every day.
