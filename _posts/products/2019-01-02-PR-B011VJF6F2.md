intro: Super common sense bathroom safety item.
---
This is one of those common-sense, practical items that if you are under 65 you may feel silly buying.  I got over that feeling some years ago when I fell head over heels stepping out of my bathtub, and for no 'good' reason.  I just slipped.  My embarrassment disappeared when my doctor told me that bathroom accidents account for thee times the number of car deaths!

In 2008 alone there were over 230,000 bathroom injuries in the U.S.  Granted, this number includes injuries from exploding toilets (what!?) but 81% of the injuries were fall related, 60% of those in the bathtub, and18% of those from slipping... so that's still around 22,000 injuries and deaths each year that could be dramatically reduced with simple things bathtub steps, nonslip strips and grab bars.

This is not a problem just for Third Agers either, as about 20% of all bathroom related emergency room visits are by the spritely 15-55 group.

So, buy this and live!
