intro: Track your blood pressre and heart rate as you walk.
---
This clever device tracks your steps and calories burned,  while recording your heartbeat and blood pressure, and has alarms, which you set, to let you know when you have hit your limit.  It also has a feature where it will let you know when you have a skype, WhatsApp or SMS message, in case your workout is very intense.  I am not sure if this is a feature or a bug, as I find this very annoying, but it can be turned off.  On the other side, it has alarms to let you know you have been sitting on your butt too long and need to move.
