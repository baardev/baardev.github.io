intro: Well reviewed, heavy duty stun gun

There is some debate as to whether a stun gun has sufficient stopping power against a determined, or crazy, attacker.  In my opinion, this is a crazy argument, because someone would have to be inhuman to not run from the INTENSE PAIN these cause.  These are also safer for the defender that a gun because if the attacker pulls it away from the defender is automatically disabled and can't be used against them.  Check out the vides below to see more details.
