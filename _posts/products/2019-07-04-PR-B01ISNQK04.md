Incredibly effective, versatile and easy to use self-defense tool.  Screams out at 130 decibels.  To put that in perspective, 130 dB is equivalent to standing 50 feet away from military jet aircraft take-off from an aircraft carrier, but this sound this alarm makes is ear-piercing sharp and can be heard far and wide.  Watch the video below to see all the other ways this device is useful.
