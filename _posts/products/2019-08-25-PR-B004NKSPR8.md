There are potential issues when using pepper spray 1) You have to be in close range, and 2) at close range you are vulnerable to the pepper spray getting blowing into your own eyes.  This spray is a gel, so no blowback, and it can shoot 18 ft (5M), which is a safe distance when fending off an attacker, be it human or animal and give you plenty of time to pull your stun gun out in case the attacker doesn't turn and run.

p.s. I was prohibited from buying this in New York City, and I suspect most areas run my democrats will also have outlawed self-defense.  Check in your area before you buy.
