intro: Video Games Are Good For Your Brain and Body.
---
Most of the news about playing video games tend to be less than favorable, but I suspect this is mainly because news organizations know they get more viewers with bad news than good news.  

So here's the good news:  You should be playing more videos games!

Typically, reports about video games playing focuses on the young, as they not only dominate the video game market, but people tend to be more concerned with the young, versus the old.  But Third Agers can benefit as much, if not more, than the young from playing video games.  Not only does video game playing provide the same benefits to the older as the younger, it has much more of a positive psychological effect on the older.

Here is a list of the benefits fo playing video games.  Below this list, I will provide scientific evidence.

_<sup>The following list is an edited  mashup from the following sources: [https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/09/8-cognitive-benefits-of-playing-video-games-for-kids/](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/09/8-cognitive-benefits-of-playing-video-games-for-kids/), [http://mentalfloss.com/article/583863/143-fred-rogers-code-i-love-you-holiday-pennsylvania](http://mentalfloss.com/article/583863/143-fred-rogers-code-i-love-you-holiday-pennsylvania), [https://pcdreams.com.sg/top-5-advantages-of-playing-video-games/](https://pcdreams.com.sg/top-5-advantages-of-playing-video-games/)</sup>_

**ENHANCES MEMORY**
Playing your favorite video game may require both visual and audial memory. The player is required to read or listen to the instructions which might only be provided at the beginning of the game, thus the need to remember them throughout the entire game. Mastery of the keys on your keyboard helps you easily move your characters in the game. This helps improve your memory, whether short- term or long-term.

**IMPROVES BRAIN SPEED**
While gaming, the brain receives multiple stimulations, both Visual and audial. According to research, individuals who play video games frequently can process these stimulators faster than others. These stimulators ensure that the brain is continuously working to interpret them.

**ENHANCES MULTITASKING SKILLS**
An action game, for example, may require you to be very observant. It requires you to be able to move your joystick or keys while looking at the various features on your screen such as energy levels, oncoming adversaries, ammunition left, available time among other factors, all which are vital to winning. This ensures that the player can observe and react accordingly to all requirements of that particular game.

**THEY COULD IMPROVE YOUR VISION**
“Don’t sit too close to the television” used to be a common parental refrain without a lot of science to back it up. Instead, scientists are discovering games in moderation may actually improve—not strain—your vision. In one study, 10 weeks of play was associated with a greater ability to discern between different shades of grey. Another had participants try to play games using only their “lazy” eye, with the “good” one obscured. Those players showed significant, sometimes normalized improvement in the affected eye.

**IMPROVES ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION**
Video games, especially action games, have proven to be able to capture the player's attention for the entire period of the game. This is brought about by the player's need to achieve certain objectives within the game, and be able to progress to the next level.

**THEY MAY SLOW THE AGING PROCESS**
So-called “brain games” involving problem-solving, memory, and puzzle components have been shown to have a positive benefit on older players. In one study, just 10 hours of play led to increased cognitive functioning in participants 50 and older—an improvement that lasted for several years.

**THEY HELP EASE PAIN**
It’s common to try to distract ourselves from pain by paying attention to something else or focusing on other body mechanisms, but that’s not the only reason why games are a good post-injury prescription. Playing can actually produce an analgesic (pain-killing) response in our higher cortical systems. The more immersive, the better—which is why pending virtual reality systems may one day be as prevalent in hospitals as hand sanitizer.  

**YOU'LL MAKE NEW SOCIAL CONNECTIONS**
Gamers are sometimes stigmatized as being too insulated, but the opposite is actually true. The rise of multi-player experiences online has given way to a new form of socializing in which players work together to solve problems. But studies have shown games can also be the catalyst for friends to gather in person: roughly 70 percent of all players play with friends at least some of the time.

**THEY MAY IMPROVE BALANCE IN MS SUFFERERS**
Since it is a disorder affecting multiple nerves, multiple sclerosis patients often have problems with their balance—and no medications have been conclusively proven to help. However, one study showed that MS patients who played games requiring physical interaction while standing on a balance board displayed improvement afterward.

**YOU'LL MAKE FASTER DECISIONS**
We all know someone who seems to have a faster CPU than the rest of us, able to retrieve information or react in a split second. For some, that ability might be strengthened through gaming. Because new information is constantly being displayed during play, players are forced to adapt quickly. In one study, players who were immersed in fast-paced games were 25 percent faster in reacting to questions about an image they had just seen compared to non-players.

**THEY MAY CURB CRAVINGS**
Players preoccupied with indulging in overeating, smoking, or drinking might be best served by reaching for a controller instead. A university study revealed a 24 percent reduction in desire for their vice of choice after playing a puzzle game.

**THEY'LL REDUCE STRESS**
While some games are thought to induce stress—especially when you see your character struck down for the umpteenth time—the opposite can be true. A major study that tracked players over six months and measured heart rate found that certain titles reduced the adrenaline response by over 50 percent.

**IMPROVES HAND AND EYE COORDINATION**
Experts agree that people who play video and computer games have better hand and eye coordination. Players have to move at a great deal of speed along with other heroes of the game. This can be helpful with children and adults as well in applying this skill in other activities that require better hand-eye coordination.

**REMEDY FOR CERTAIN HEALTH DISORDERS**
There are many medical institutions that utilize computer games as a form of physiotherapy. This kind of games helps people recover fast from physical injuries and help them improve their motor and coordination skills as well. Distraction is the best natural remedy for pain, and what other things loaded with so much fun as video games?

**IMAGINATION BOOSTER**
In the world of computer games, the possibilities are endless. Video gaming is packed with a lot of adventure that forces your mind to think in a completely new and different way. You’ll be amazed to know how far your imagination can take you.

**IMPROVES PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS**
This type of game requires problem-solving skills. You are the heroine of your own game, so you should have a good decision making skill. Most games inspire players to strive and reach more difficult levels presenting challenges at every stage.

**THEY'RE PRODUCING BETTER SURGEONS**
While you may think you want your surgeon reading up on the latest medical research instead of playing games, you might want to reconsider: a study of laparoscopic (small incision) specialists found that those who played for more than three hours per week made 32 percent fewer errors during practice procedures compared to their non-gaming counterparts.  

**THEY MAY HELP PEOPLE OVERCOME DYSLEXIA**
Some research points to attention difficulties as being a key component of dyslexia. One study has shown dyslexics improved their reading comprehension following sessions of games heavy on action. The reason, researchers believe, is that the games have constantly changing environments that require intense focus.

**YOU MIGHT GET A CAREER BOOST**
Because certain genres of games reward and encourage leadership traits—providing for “communities,” securing their safety, etc.—researchers have noted that players can display a correlating motivation in their real-world career goals. Improvising in a game can also translate into being faster on your feet when an office crisis crops up.

**A NEW WAY OF TEACHING**
Almost all children have access to video games as they study in school. There are many educational institutions nowadays that use video games as a teaching methodology. This approach works best in teaching these children to improve their academic skills. There are many video games that were specifically made to develop their cognitive and creative thinking skills.

**GAMERS MIGHT BE LESS LIKELY TO BULLY**
Though the stance is controversial, some researchers have asserted that action games may reduce a bully’s motivation to—well, bully. One study that had players assume the role of both the hero and villain showed that those controlling the bad guy’s behaviors displayed a greater sense of remorse over their actions.

**THEY CAN HELP ADDRESS AUTISM**
Gamers using systems that incorporate the entire body to control onscreen movement have been shown to be more engaged in celebrating victories with their peers, which runs counter to the lack of communication people with autism sometimes present. A study also showed that sharing space with multiple players can also lead to increased social interaction for those with the disorder.

**PLAYERS CAN BECOME FASCINATED WITH HISTORY**
Many games use actual historical events to drive their stories. Those characters and places can then spark a child’s interest in discovering more about the culture they’re immersed in, according to researchers. Parents who have obtained books, maps, and other resources connected to games have reported their children are more engaged with learning, which can lead to a lifetime appreciation for history.

**THEY MAKE KIDS PHYSICAL**
While some games promote a whole-body level of interaction, even those requiring a simple handheld controller can lead to physical activity. Sports games that involve basketball, tennis, or even skateboarding can lead to children practicing those same skills outdoors.

**GREAT SOURCE OF LEARNING**
Gaming is not only beneficial to adults and teenagers, but to children as well. Many modern education institutions incorporate video games as a teaching methodology. This helps these children improve their academic skills by providing video games that are specifically aimed at enhancing their cognitive and creative skills.


### The Proof

 _<sup>(from [https://www.sciencealert.com/6-scientific-benefits-of-playing-videogames](https://www.sciencealert.com/6-scientific-benefits-of-playing-videogames))</sup>_

The jury is in – video games are not the mind-melting devil creations that your parents made them out to be.

Not only can gaming be a whole lot of fun, but recent research has revealed there's also a range of scientific benefits to playing videogames – everything from increasing brain matter to pain relief.

Here are six of the best benefits to tell your friends next time you blow off drinks to game:

**1: 3D video games could increase memory capacity**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-01.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-01.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:left"/></a>
In a 2015 study in The Journal of Neuroscience, researchers from the University of California, Irvine recruited 69 participants and asked a third to play Super Mario 3D World for two weeks, a third to play Angry Birds, and the rest to play nothing.

"Because of their engaging experiences and enriching 3D virtual environments, the same video games that have been played for decades by children and adults alike may actually provide our brain with meaningful stimulation," the researchers wrote.

The people who played Mario ended up doing better on follow-up memory tasks, while the others showed no improvement pre- and post-gaming.

"Video gamers who specifically favor complex 3D video games performed better," the researchers concluded.  

**2: Gaming could be good for pain relief**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-02.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-02.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:right"/></a>
This one is the best excuse for playing video games on your next sick day – a 2012 literature review published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that in the 38 studies examined, video games improved the health outcomes of 195 patients on every front, including psychological and physical therapy.

Plus, in 2010, scientists presented research at the American Pain Society's conference, which found evidence that playing video games, especially virtual reality games, are effective at reducing anxiety or pain caused by chronic illness or medical procedures.

"The focus is drawn to the game, not the pain or the medical procedure, while the virtual reality experience engages visual and other senses," said Jeffrey Gold from the University of Southern California.

**3: There's evidence games help dyslexic kids improve their reading**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-03.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-03.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:left"/></a>Video games can help kids, too!

A 2013 study published in Cell investigated the effect that playing action games, like 'Rayman Raving Rabbids', could help dyslexic children aged 7 to 13 year read faster, with no loss in accuracy.

The results were equal or better to traditional reading treatments, which can be more time consuming and not as fun.

The researchers think that the fast pace in these games helped the kids increase their attention spans, although this hypothesis is yet to be tested.

**4: Tetris could help limit trauma**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-04.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-04.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:right"/></a>Trusty old Tetris might be good for more than just time wasting if this new study is anything to go by.

Last year, 37 patients that arrived at a hospital emergency department in Oxford, UK, to be treated for a traffic accident were randomly selected to play 20 minutes of Tetris.

Another 34 patients didn't get given the game but were asked to log their regular activity instead – including things such as texting, crosswords, and reading.

The Tetris players had significantly fewer flashbacks to the traumatic traffic event than those that didn't – about 62 percent less on average.

The research, published last month in Molecular Psychiatry, concludes that the "brief, science-driven intervention offers a low-intensity means that could substantially improve the mental health of those who have experienced psychological trauma."  

**5: Some research shows that video games might actually make you smarter**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-05.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-06.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:left"/></a>Video games can help kids, too! A study published in PLoS ONE in 2013 goes as far as saying that your cognition might be enhanced when you start up your Xbox or PlayStation.

The researchers took five groups of non-gamers and made them play a phone game for one hour a day over four weeks.

They found that all video games, both action, and non-action games, improved cognitive function in the participants – measured by tests such as short term memory tasks.

**6: Gaming is linked to an increase in brain matter**

<a href="/mish/assets/files/KN-2910-insert-06.pdf"><img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2910-insert-07.jpg" style="margin:10px;border:1px solid grey;width:34%;float:right"/></a>And finally – a 2014 study published in Molecular Psychiatry by researchers from the Max Planck Institute in Germany from the found that playing Super Mario 64 caused an increase in the size of brain regions.

Specifically the bits of the brain responsible for spatial orientation, memory formation, strategic planning, and fine motor skills.

When the researchers looked at 24 participants who had played the game for 30 minutes a day for two months under an MRI machine they found that they had increased grey matter in the right hippocampus, right prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum, compared to a control group that hadn't played any game.

"This proves that specific brain regions can be trained by means of video games", said one of the researchers, Simone Küh, at the time.
