intro: Hanging upside down has saved many people from back surgery, but it is one of the best preventative practices you can do for spinal health.

#### _**Inversion therapy - cheap and easy:** Benefits of inversions therapy (hanging upside down), and how to do it (super cheap)_

Although this is purely anecdotal, I have noticed that the back exercises I had been doing, which consisted of taking sidesteps with a big rubber band around my knees, became much easier after hanging upside down. Before hanging I could do 50 left and 50 right steps before my back muscles were fatigued and cramping to the point where I could barely stand. After 2 months of hanging (and NOT doing ANY back exercises), I found I could to 50 left and right with barely any discomfort! In fact, I could push myself to 150.

So I did a bit of research into this.

In this day of seemingly infinite information on any subject from every perspective, it can be hard to filter out what it "true" and what is not, or even what is believable or not.  For example, in my research, I ran across a fascinating paper that theorizes on the dangers of salmonella originating from joy-riding pigs!  ([I'm not kidding!!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1348911/)).

I did find seemingly legitimate articles such as "[Why Stretching Might Be Bad For You](https://www.medicaldaily.com/why-stretching-might-be-bad-you-244891)" and "[Why Stretching May Actually Be Doing More Harm Than Good](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-17592/why-stretching-may-actually-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html)," however, as my experience has been significantly beneficial to me, I am going to assume that none of their warnings apply to me... that much.

So here are some more supportive views of stretching...

In the article "[Does Stretching Help Muscle Growth?](https://www.livestrong.com/article/262328-does-stretching-help-muscle-growth/)" they cite a study that discovered "Muscle mass and length increased significantly" due to stretching.

The American Council on Exercise has their own [10 reasons to stretch](https://www.acefitness.org/about-ace/press-room/press-releases/325/ace-lists-top-ten-reasons-to-stretch) (muscle growth is not one of them).

As for inversion therapy itself, again, there are wildly differing opinions.  Harvard, for example, [makes inversion therapy sound pretty useless and even dangerous](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/do-inversion-tables-work)

>Experts regard inversion tables as a form of spinal traction. Instead of increasing disk space, traction is more likely to stretch the muscles and ligaments around the spine and temporarily relieve muscle spasm. That may be why some people get short-term relief from back pain after lying on an inversion table. But spinal traction doesn't provide long-term relief. A 2006 Cochrane Review (a summary of evidence from randomized trials) concluded that there was no evidence to recommend traction for the treatment of low back pain.  Using an inversion table is not without risk: it raises blood pressure, lowers heart rate, and increases pressure in the eye. In some users, it has caused bleeding into the retina. It's also been associated with headache and blurred vision. Don't use an inversion table if you're pregnant or if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or glaucoma or any other eye disease.

My own experiences are radically different, so again, I have to assume their warnings do not apply 100% of the time.

On the other hand, Providence Health Services, who provide care for hundreds of thousands of patients in five states, [says that inversion therapy](https://blog.providence.org/archive/change-your-pov-can-hanging-upside-down-improve-your-health) can

* Relieving back pain
* Maintaining posture
* Relaxing muscles
* Clearing the lymph system
* Improving blood circulation

I am going with  Providence Health Services on this one while remaining aware of the potential risks.

As you can see in my video, I use a $20 four meter "seat belt" for my inversions.  It works fine, but I would prefer to hang from my ankles, and my "seatbelt" is sometimes a bit uncomfortable.

Here are other options...
