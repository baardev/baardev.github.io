intro: VR can change you.

The elderly disproportionately suffer from mental and psychological problems.  

This may sound like an odd sentence to begin a blog on virtual reality (VR), but the two are very related.

It'sd called "Late-Life psychosis", and includes such things as paranoia, delusions, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, and many related symptoms of these illnesses.   However, with 31% of U.S adults reporting to have experiences anxiety disorders, it appears that people of all ages are in need to help.

There and a number of reasons why the elderly are more vulnerable, aside from the toll of years.  For example, []"disordered thinking" and paranoia have been linked to loss of hearing, of all things](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/23/science/paranoia-in-elderly-attributed-to-unrecognized-hearing.html).  Of course, there are neurological issues as well that can result in dementia, memory loss, and various other issues that have numerous psychological consequences.  in addition, sleep deprivation, dehydration, substance abuse, liver or kidney failure,

and many other ailments can cause hallucinations and delusions.

So, what does all this have to do with VR?  Well, it turns out that VR is being successfully used to treat certain psychological illnesses, such as paranoia and anxiety.

For example

> "One of the most effective treatments of anxiety is exposure therapy: a person is exposed to specific feared situations or objects that trigger anxiety. This exposure process may be done through actual exposure, with visualization, by imagination or using virtual reality (VR), that provides users with computer simulated environments with and within which they can interact" _-- Virtual reality in anxiety disorders: the past and the future._

>"Researchers have been developing virtual reality systems that help people overcome specific phobias since the 1990s. VR therapy has since expanded to address more complex anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and even the anxiety associated with paranoid schizophrenia" _--Virtual reality therapy has real-life benefits for some mental disorders_

>"This study demonstrates that virtual reality has an augmented effect on balance and associated locomotor recovery in adults with hemiparetic stroke when added to conventional therapy." _-- Use of Virtual Reality to Enhance Balance and Ambulation in Chronic Stroke_

There are many research reports on the subject, as you can see with a quick search of Google Scholar.

Also, check out this [meditative walk](http://www.focusforwardfilms.com/films/65/in-your-head) specifically designed to reduce chronic pain.

Of course, most of the work being done with VR has been in a controlled environment, with specific tests and applications, but there are numerous applications on the market today that tout psychological benefits.  Here are some examples

### Deep VR

Deep VR will become more than just a calming escape for VR enthusiasts; it's now the basis for a psychological study that aims to alleviate anxiety in children (and presumably adults as well).

### Google's Tilt Brush

This is Google VR/3D paint program, and it's pretty damn cool!  No, it's much more than cool!!

#### _Experience "The Great Wave" in Virtual Reality! We partnered with our friends at VR Scout to bring you a season full of virtual reality art made in Tilt Brush. This time, we asked artist James R. Eads to recreate famous paintings in virtual reality, so we can all experience the magic of these paintings up close! He recreated Hokusai's "The Great Wave" in VR._

And we can't discount the therapeutic benefits of blowing zombies away, learning to fly a jetliner, racing, space travel, and so many other fun, exciting, revitalizing experiences that one can have in the VR world.

Using VR as a form of therapy is quite compatible with existing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) when you look at the CBT's classic loop.

Simply put, VR can create an immersive experience that can make the user feel "better" (at peace, less anxious, more free, etc, depending on the circumstances), and that reinforces supporting thoughts, which enhances those feelings.

CBS News did a short piece on using VR with ThirdAgers, and it's pretty impressive.  Even though the products and service they review is not yet on the market, and will cost (probably a lot of ) money, it's clear how entering a VR world radically changed them.

#### _Senior community explores the world with virtual reality: The virtual reality industry is still in its infancy, with just over two million headsets expected to be sold this year. But one MIT startup believes this cutting-edge technology is the perfect fit for seniors. Michelle Miller witnessed the unexpected pairing at one Massachusetts senior community._

The final 'pitch' here as to the benefit of VR especially to the ThirdAge crowd, and even more so to those who are infirmed , watch this funny, and eye-opening video.

### Just the beginning

There is a lot of evidence suggesting that VR can not only change a person's perception of reality but can actually change neurological wiring in the brain.  It seems likely that we will discover techniques, using VR, that can induce self-healing, lucid dreaming, out-of-body-experiences, increased learning capacity along with radically new ways to learn, and many other abilities we can't even imagine right now.

I will leave with this fascinating video about the future of VR from TEDx.  Enjoy.
