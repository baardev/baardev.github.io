intro: Who couldn't use a better memory?
---

Memory tends to slip with age.  Here is a chart that shows how working-memory, long-term memory and processing speed start their steady decline starting at the age of 20.  it's not that older people start losing their memory when they get up there in years... it's just that the loss that has been going on since their 20's has started to get a bit more obvious.  So, don't think that memory exercises are just for old folks... people should be starting this workout when they are young.

Worse, we tend to make matters worse by generally being lazy about keeping our memory in "shape".  Here are a few related articles on how to do just that.

First off, like with any exercise plan, you need to have a healthy diet...

## Perform Memory Improvement Exercises Daily for a Stronger Brain
Want a stronger brain? Weave memory improvement exercises into your daily routine. Constantly challenge your memory. Put your memory to work!

Your memory isn't a muscle, but it does react like one. Fail to use your muscles, and you become physically weak. Just ask anyone who has had to stay in bed for a month due to illness.

Neglect your memory, and your ability to remember things will decrease too.

Athletes don't mind the hours spent in the gym. They want the added strength and stamina. View yourself as a "mental athlete," and reap the rewards of a stronger brain.

Look for ways to engage your memory. Create your own memory improvement exercises, and embrace the mental effort.

Earlier generations were forced to use their memories. A hundred years ago, the average person probably had a better memory than we do today. We are so dependent on crutches to help us remember that we've nearly lost the skill.

Electronic organizers, calculators, computers, etc. have their place but lessen mental effort.

## Try these Memory Exercises
Make the memory improvement exercises below your own. Embed them in your daily routine. Modify them to your own situation. Some may seem difficult at first. That's an indication of how weak your brain has become!

Not only will this mental activity improve your memory and sharpen your brain in the short run, it may protect you from Alzheimer's disease.

- Memorize the phone numbers of your ten closest friends and relatives. After that, memorize ten more. Then ten more.
- When grocery shopping, mentally keep a running total of the value of the items in your cart. At first, round off prices to make it easier. For a real challenge, include the exact amounts of dollars and cents as you perform the mental computations.
- Memorize your grocery list, especially if you only need a dozen items or less. It's okay to keep a written copy in your pocket for review when you're done shopping.
- Join one or more card-playing groups. Bridge, Canasta, Euchre, Canasta, Poker - it doesn't matter. Play with the group at least twice a month.
- If you have someone to play board games with, start a game night. Play a different board game once a week. Choose challenging games. If checkers is too easy, learn chess.
- Create short-term memory tests. Place a dozen small objects on a table. Examples: button, coin, photo, pencil, paperclip, key, etc. Take ten seconds to memorize the items, then cover with a hat or cloth. Recall, out loud, as many as you can.
- Complete a crossword puzzle a day. Buy a crossword book which has dozens of puzzles such as the New York Times crossword collection, or complete the puzzle in your daily newspaper.
- Memorize one "top ten list" each day. Examples: Top 10 Greatest Mathematicians, 10 Huge Prehistoric Cats, 10 Most Common Food Allergies, Top 10 - Castles and Palaces. Type "top ten lists" into a Google search, and you'll find dozens.
- Learn a craft or hobby. Pick something challenging and intriguing. Become an expert.
- Spend 10 minutes a day memorizing place names from around the globe. First challenge yourself to memorize the U.S. state capitals. Then memorize the names of the countries on each continent. Then memorize the capitals of those countries.
- When you meet someone new, memorize at least three pieces of information about them besides their name. Write this information down later on an index card. Periodically study your cards.
- Create flash cards on a subject you know nothing about. Make 50 flash cards that define the main concepts of that topic. Memorize the cards, and test yourself periodically. Wrap each stack with a rubber band, or file them in small boxes to keep them organized.
- Recall facts in reverse order. Don't waste those minutes spent in an elevator, during your morning commute, or other times when you are waiting or sitting idle.
For example, say or think the letters of the alphabet in reverse order. It's challenging the first time. As you get better, say or think it faster. Even time yourself!
- There are lots of math sequences that can be said backward that require you to concentrate intensely and think hard. For instance, try counting backward from 100 by 3's. Too easy? Try counting backward by 7's, etc. It's a brain workout on the go.
- Practice taking mental snapshots at events you want to remember. This technique can help you create clear visual memories of the special moments in your life.
- Memorize the order of the playing cards in a randomly shuffled deck. No, this isn't impossible! Use the visualization memory systems described elsewhere on this site.
- Memorize the lyrics of your favorite songs. To get the lyrics, type the song name plus the word "lyrics" into a Google search.
- Determine to learn a new language. Find a native speaker who you can converse with on a regular basis. Become bilingual!
- After reading a book, write down a summary of the plot or main points of the book plus what you learned. If you don't read much, start now with the classics.
- Keep a daily journal. At day's end, recall what happened that day and write it down in as much detail as you can.
- Before going to sleep, recount to yourself the events of your day. The more you practice this, the better you'll get at remembering even small details. Your powers of observation will improve, as will your concentration.
- Some people take this beyond a memory exercise. They mentally "thank" each person they interacted with that day; or, like Seneca, review mistakes they made (got angry, were selfish, told a lie, etc.), considering how to avoid such errors in the future.
- These are just a few ideas for memory improvement exercises.

You can think of many more if you put your mind to it. Push your brain to the limit, and you will be rewarded.

Concerned your memory will worsen as you get older? Now is the time to take action.

To use another well-worn expression, you don't get something for nothing. And you can't have a strong memory (or, as you age, likely even keep the one you have) without investing time and effort.

Build a program of memory improvement exercises into your daily routine, and you won't regret it.

## 10 Brain Exercises That Boost Memory
Keep your brain as healthy and fit as your body with these simple tips.

We don’t just lose muscle over time — our brains can atrophy, too. More specifically, your brain's cognitive reserve — its ability to withstand neurological damage due to aging and other factors without showing visible signs of slowing or memory loss — diminishes through the years. That can make it more difficult to perform mental tasks. But just as weight workouts add lean muscle to your body and help you retain more muscle in your later years, researchers now believe that following a brain-healthy lifestyle and performing regular, targeted brain exercises can also increase your brain's cognitive reserve.

## The Healthy Brain: A Multifaceted Approach
In one of the most detailed studies on the connection between lifestyle and dementia risk to date, researchers found that people who participate in multiple healthy behaviors significantly reduce their risk for dementia. The 2013 study, published in PLOS ONE, looked at 2,235 men for 30 years and measured their participation in five healthy lifestyle behaviors: non-smoking, optimal BMI, high fruit and vegetable intake, regular physical activity, and low to moderate alcohol intake. The study participants who followed four or all five of the behaviors were about 60 percent less likely to develop cognitive impairment and dementia.

"Approaches to [brain health include a well-balanced diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/longevity/healthy-eating-recommendations.aspx) low in fat, low in cholesterol, and high in antioxidants," says Robert Bender, MD, medical director of the Johnny Orr Memory Center and Healthy Aging Institute in Des Moines, Iowa.

In addition to good nutrition, [regular exercise can promote vascular health](https://www.everydayhealth.com/senior-health/staying-active.aspx) to help protect brain tissue. Avoiding ruts and boredom is also critical. "The brain wants to learn new things," says Dr. Bender, noting that some researchers believe that people are more vulnerable to dementia when they pay less attention to the things around them. "When the brain is passive, it has a tendency to atrophy," he adds. For this reason, sedentary and relatively passive activities, such as sitting in front of a TV for hours a day, can be detrimental to brain health over time.

## 10 Real-World Brain Exercises That Work
On top of a healthy diet and regular exercise, there are ways to give your brain its own workout routine — without emptying your wallet. Although brain training software is everywhere these days, it has yet to show any significant neurological benefits for older adults. In a 2014 review published in PLOS Medicine, Australian researchers looked at [52 different studies on computerized cognitive training](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001756) on a total 4,885 participants and found that the games are not particularly effective in improving brain performance.

Experts recommend sticking to brain training that involves real-world activities. Exercises to strengthen brain function should offer novelty and challenge. "Almost any silly suggestion can work," says David Eagleman, PhD, neuroscientist and assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. "Drive home via a different route; brush your teeth with your opposite hand. [The brain works through associations](https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/surprising-hobby-protects-one-mans-aging-brain/) (which is why it's easier to memorize lyrics to a song than it is to try and remember the same words without music), so the more senses you involve the better."

Your morning newspaper is a great place to start. "Simple games like Sudoku and word games are good, as well as comic strips where you find things that are different from one picture to the next," says John E. Morley, MD, director of St. Louis University's Division of Geriatric Medicine and author of The Science of Staying Young. In addition to word games, Dr. Morley recommends the following exercises to sharpen your mental skills:

- **Test your recall.** Make a list — of grocery items, things to do, or anything else that comes to mind — and memorize it. An hour or so later, see how many items you can recall. Make items on the list as challenging as possible for the greatest mental stimulation.
- **Let the music play.** Learn to play a musical instrument or join a choir. Studies show that learning something new and complex over a longer period of time is ideal for the aging mind.
- **Do math in your head.** Figure out problems without the aid of pencil, paper, or computer; you can make this more difficult — and athletic — by walking at the same time.
- **Take a cooking class.** Learn how to cook a new cuisine. Cooking uses a number of senses: smell, touch, sight, and taste, which all involve different parts of the brain.
- **Learn a foreign language.** The listening and hearing involved stimulates the brain. What’s more, a rich vocabulary has been linked to a reduced risk for cognitive decline.
- **Create word pictures.** Visualize the spelling of a word in your head, then try and think of any other words that begin (or end) with the same two letters.
- **Draw a map from memory.** After returning home from visiting a new place, try to draw a map of the area; repeat this exercise each time you visit a new location.
- **Challenge your taste buds.** When eating, try to identify individual ingredients in your meal, including subtle herbs and spices.
- **Refine your hand-eye abilities.** Take up a new hobby that involves fine-motor skills, such as knitting, drawing, painting, assembling a puzzle, etc.
- **Learn a new sport.** Start doing an athletic exercise that utilizes both mind and body, such as yoga, golf, or tennis.

Soon people will realize that they can take steps to keep their brains healthy, just as they know they can [prevent heart disease](https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/treatment-prevention/) by taking certain actions, says Bender. "In the coming decade, I predict brain wellness to be right up there with heart health — now that there's proof that living a brain-healthy lifestyle works!”

## Habits to Strengthen the Mind Every Day
by Vikki Cheung, ThirdAge.Life contributor

Personally I am very mindful of my brain slowly turning to mush. Here are my daily mental exercises and habits to strengthen the mind and my focus and attention.

**1.  I read every day.**
This habit is not difficult for me at all. I have always read in bed every night before going to sleep. I always have one fiction book and one nonfiction book I'm reading at a time. On my Kindle, I have a lot of reading materials, so there's really no excuse.

_Reading is how I feed my brain._

It's true that I enjoy reading books a lot more than most, but if you're reading about topics or stories that interest you, it's quite easy to keep up with this habit. Even if I fall asleep reading after 2 pages, I count it as a win.

**2.  I enjoy doing daily chores. No complaining.**
So this one might cause some eyes to roll, but hey, it's working for me.

Every day I have to wash dishes, tidy up the kitchen counter, etc.,  so during these chores — which I have to do ANYWAY — I try to hold a positive or at least neutral attitude toward the task at hand.

I try to talk to myself in a helpful tone. This seems very silly, but I say stuff like this to myself:

_"Good job doing this now so you don't have to do it later! You're becoming so good at getting stuff done without procrastinating!"
Trust me, it helps! I feel accomplished for little things I do, and this helps to lift my mental and emotional burdens throughout the day._

These chores are also productive in keeping a clean living space, which is also important to mental and emotional health and stability.

**3.  I make an effort to do SOMETHING to the utmost every day.**

I'm a lazy person by nature. Some people aren't, but I am.

So every day I challenge myself to do something with utmost carefulness, attention, and effort! And that includes sometimes just doing the dishes (see #2 above) with all-out effort and doing it lazily in a half-assed way. Examples:

_"I'm going to shovel this snow with all my might!"_
_"I'm going to do the best job I can to make this omelette!"_

Yes, my self-talk has a lot of exclamation points.

With this habit, I will over time develop the habit of always putting a good effort for anything I'm doing. If something is occupying my time anyway, I might as well do it with intention and purpose, making a simple task more fulfilling. It has to do with noticing my attitude and developing positive associations with daily work.
