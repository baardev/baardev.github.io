---

Claire is a practicing geriatrician who has recently taken to research to try to understand how some older individuals become frail, while others successfully age. She graduated with first class honours from Cambridge University and Bart's and the London Medical School, and spent several years working the acute medicine wards in central London. Finding so many unanswered questions about how we treat, and how we might prevent frailty, she competed for and won a Wellcome Trust Research Fellowship to investigate the key to successful ageing within older twins.
