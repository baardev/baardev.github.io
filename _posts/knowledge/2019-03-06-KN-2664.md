intro: An amazingly versatile tool.

The hot glue gun is such a practical, versatile and fun tool it is worthy of their own page.

What is hot glue?  It is a form of plastic that melts into a viscous goo at about 250F degrees (or up to 380F degrees for the tougher stuff).

Hot glue can be used on porous and non-porous surfaces. Because of its high viscosity, it can bond uneven surfaces together and is great at filling gaps.

**Definitely not for use by children.**

What can you actually do with a hot glue gun?  You'd be amazed! They are sorta like a manual version of a 3DE-printer.  People make shoes, wallets, bottle tops, clothes hangers, and about a thousand other things. Here are three videos that give you some ideas.

There are all kinds of hot glues available... different colors, glow in the dark, glittered, and probably many other types I do not know about.  Presumably, they all work with your standard gun.

Here is [COOLTOOL](https://www.cooltools.us/)'s review video talk's about what he considered the best glue guns out there.

### Some techy info on hot glue.

The adhesive you need to accomplish a specific task can vary widely, so it’s important to know what adhesives are best suited for your application.

**EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate)**

EVA copolymers are low-performance, the low-cost and the most common material for the glue sticks. They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60–80 °C and have low creep resistance under load.

**Polyethylene**
This is a  low-performance adhesive glue for difficult-to-bond plastics. Very good adhesion to polypropylene, good moisture barrier, chemical resistance against polar solvents and solutions of acids, bases, and alcohols. Longer open time in comparison with EVA and polyamides.

**3) Metallocene**

Light colored and low odor, providing excellent thermal stability and electrical insulation.

**APAO (Amorphous Poly Alpha Olafins)**

APAO adhesives are best used where open time and tack are required. These adhesives offer a soft, tacky and flexible texture, making them an excellent choice for product assembly.  Also, they are resistant to solvents.

**Polyamides**

A high-performance adhesive for severe environments and high-temperature. Typically applied at over 200 °C and has adequate bonding from -40 to 70 °C; some compositions allow operation to 185 °C if they do not have to carry load.
