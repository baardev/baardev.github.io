intro: Choosing and using a backpack specifically to care for you back (and shoulders, neck, hip, and knees).

Before researching this subject I had no idea of the level of research that has gone into backpack design and use.  It's quite extensive, as you can see by the list of research articles posted below.

Beyond the basic "don'ts" of using a backpack, such as ...

there are a number of other details to consider. On the more plebian front, REI does a good job on explaining backpack basics.

#### _How to Fit a Backpacking Pack || REI: When you’re looking for the right backpacking pack, nothing is more important than fit. In this video, Katie and Miranda walk you through the process of measuring your torso to find the right size pack, then they show you how to fine-tune the straps to make sure it fits like a glove._

Here is REI's sizing chart, as well as some other useful backpack info.

For purposes of this post, we are only going to look at details related to using a backpack to avoid or minimize back pain.

There are four details to looks at.

### Hip straps and Weight Distribution

Hip straps can reduce shoulder weight by 80%, or more if the load is low (i.e half empty backpack with the weight at the bottom.)  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children should carry no more than 10% to 20% of the body weight of a person.

In theory, this may be correct, but in reality, the weight of the person should be the weight of a HEALTHY person of the same size MINUS any additional weight.  For example. a person who would be 185 pounds when not overweight, but actually weighs 220 pounds, should calculate the weight as 185 - (220-185), which is 185 -35, which is 150 lbs.  So, a 185 lb. person who is 35 pounds overweight should only carry a load of 20% max of 150 lbs, which is just 30 lbs.  The reason for this is made clear below.

It is not clear why or how the AAP came up with the number of 20%, but we can arrive at a similar number if we take a person of  "normal" weight (i.e. not overweight, not underweight, with a BMI of 21.5)  of 150 lbs, at the "normal" height  (in the west) of 5' 10", load him up with weight, set him walking and monitor how much work he expends to carry that weight.

<img alt="" src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2680-insert-03.jpg" style="width:100%"/>

We can see that there are two high points in the workload; at the first instance of any load, and at a 20 kg (44 lbs.).  However, we assume that the second high point begins around 16kg (35 lbs.) based on the interpolation of the data.  This also appears to be the most efficient point, where the least amount of work is being expended per pound. This shows that carrying more than 23% of your body weight is more inefficient, takes more work per pound than carrying less than 23%.  So, 20% is a safe number.

For a 185 lb man, that would be a max of a 30 lbs.  Of that 30 pounds, 80%, or 24 lbs., is supported by the hips, leaving 6 pounds maximum will be hanging on the back.

### Factoring Body Weight

This does not mean a 300 lb man can, or should, load up with 45 lbs.  It has been determined that ( in "[Energy cost of load carriage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13899836)") that there is no difference in the body mechanics of carrying an extra load body weight or an extra load from external weight, like a backpack.

According to the highly referenced Messier Study ([Weight loss reduces knee‐joint loads in overweight and obese older adults with knee osteoarthritis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.21139)), for every 1 lb. of weight loss that occurs, there is a resulting 4-lb. reduction in knee joint load or knee pressure. Furthermore, the study suggested that individuals who lost 10 lbs. would be subject to a total of 48,000 fewer pounds of pressure for every mile walked!  When we walk, especially up a hill or upstairs, any additional weight is multiplied up to 4 times due to inertia.  In fact, we experience this inertia with every step when we transition from the "trailing" to "leading" positions,  This transition is called the "collision", followed by a "rebound."

 <img alt="" src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2680-insert-04.png" style="width:100%"/>

#### _COM = center of mass_

These "collisions" produce 1.2 times the standing pressure when there is no weight, and 1.6 times the standing pressure with 44 lbs.

6 lbs. extra can add from 9 lbs. to up to 24 lbs. of "collision" pressure, so, if you have back pain due to compressed discs, pinched nerves, sciatica, hernia or any pressure related ailments, you'll want to reduce that pressure as much as you can.

Another excellent demonstration of how posture can affect the weight of a spinal pressure point is how just holding your head 3 inches off-center can increase the weight by almost 4x !

Low-loading your backpack to keep most or all of the weight supported by your hip strap is a good idea.   One thing I do is use two fanny packs and one leg pack and load those up with heavy items.  The only real disadvantage is going through customs because you have to take them off, open them up, put them back on, etc.  Other than that, they turned out to be very useful and versatile.

I am waiting for someone to make a decent backpack that also has wheels.  It's not that it is a technical challenge, it's just that backpackers (and the companies that serve them) tend to sneer at such a thing.  To quote a response from a travel board where others were looking for good wheeled backpacks ...

> "Good wheeled backpack" is considered an oxymoron by most serious backpackers, myself included. Wheels add extra weight, rigidity, and break-ability to what otherwise could be a perfect bag.

So, until companies discover the market for people that have back issues but still manage to maintain an active lifestyle we'll have to make do with what there is.

For me, there are a few different backpacks that work well, considering everything said so far.

For Urban travel, something like the "Gonex 35L Small Hiking Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CGLHG2Q/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d) (and, no, we are not sponsored in any way by them), is great for laptops, books, limited grocery shopping, and other urban-esque tasks.

If your urban travel includes airports and long distance travel, something like the [Aidonger Vintage Canvas Hiking Daypack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVW7GX8/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d) might be better.

These are good mainly because they have a waist strap, are fairly flat, so as not to alter the center of gravity much, and are very economical.  However, even the much more expensive models don't have the same advantages, so it just good luck they are a deal.

For rural adventures, I need something that allows bottom loading, so ideally the more of the backpack that sits below the waistbelt, the better.  I can't be lugging around 50 pounds as I (unwisely) did in my youth, but I can easily bottom-load 20 pounds.

For example, the [AW Outdoor 70L Sports Hiking Camping Backpack Travel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1IJUNJ/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d), which hangs low below the strap, so it's great for low-loading, and it's fairly large (70L), so I can keep most of what I need in the bottom half.  There is also the smaller [Promover 48L Hiking Backpack Travel Daypack Camping Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G83W64W/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d).

Another smaller pack (40L) that is good for outdoor and can be used in an urban setting without looking like you're trying to find a hostile is the [Diamond Candy Waterproof Hiking Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPHPHSG/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d).

### Caveats

However, the knees and the ankles will bear the full brunt of the additional weight.

> "The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30% stride). -- from "Mechanics and energetics of load carriage during human walking"

If you are overweight adding any load will exacerbate your already stressed out body and joints as overweight people are 30 to 79 percent more likely to experience degenerative disc disease, are high risk for hernias, pinched nerves, spinal arthritis, osteoarthritis, and musculoskeletal injury.  So, if you are overweight, don't start backpacking, or carrying anything, until you drop some pounds.
