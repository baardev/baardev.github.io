intro: Do eye exercises help to improve eyesight?  Yes, no, and maybe.
---
There are a lot of books and videos that claim you can improve your eyesight with exercises.  I have tried some of them myself but saw no improvement, so I decided to actually do some research and see if they really to work.  Yes, I should have done my research ahead of time, but I'm more of an act-first-and-then-wonder-if-it-was-a-good-idea-later sort of person.  For the more thoughtful out there, I am sharing this research with you.

the answer to whether eye exercises work to improve vision is "yes" and "no", depending on why you have bad vision.

### The NO Part

The "no" part is, if you have any of the following problems, exercise seems to have little to no effect.

* Near-sightedness (myopia)
* Far-sightedness (hyperopia)
* Astigmatism
* Age-related macular degeneration
* Cataracts
* Glaucoma
* Presbyopia (age-related lens stiffening)

Unfortunately, there have been no modern clinical studies on the effectiveness of exercise on these problems, so we don't know the extent they work or do anything.  What we do know is that doing eye exercises BEFORE you have eye problems can delay on onset fo these problems, but once you have the problems, getting rid of it seem difficult, if not impossible.

The most popular eye exercise that makes the claim that it can improve eyesight is the Bates Method, created by a New Jersey doctor William Bates, about 100 years ago.  Some of his proponents are quite convincing, such as this kid from Norway.

#### _How I improved my Eyesight with Eye Exercises: The links on the YouTube page for this video also have some other links that those interested might find valuable._

Unfortunately, as convincing as his video is, he (and this is the case with most similar videos), he does not detail what his problems were beforehand, so we can't be sure what problems are being affected by the exercises.

Keep in mind that convincing anecdotal evidence is not really enough.  If it were we could deploy techniques used long ago, which are convincingly described.  Take, for example, the account of Benevenutus Grassus of Jerusalem, the foremost oculist and surgeon of the Middle Ages, who found a cure for glaucoma ("or as he called it, a 'fog over the pupil')...

For this condition, I will prescribe, for your information, a marvelous cure, the result of my experiences in such cases.  Take a precious stone we call sapphire,  Powder it most thoroughly in a metal mortar and store it in a golden vase.  Put a little in the patient's eye every day and he will be cured.

If someone out there wants to try this and get back to me I would love to hear the result.

By the same token, there are numerous claims that taking LSD (of fairly heroic doses) improves one's vision (actual vision, not 'visions').  Again, I am not saying that is not true, but I would want to see some actual studies on that before recommending a trip down Timoty Leary Lane.

If you want to know more about the Bates method you can watch this hour and a half webinar.

#### _How to Succeed with the Bates Method to Improve Your Eyesight: This webinar by Greg Marsh will start you toward successful eyesight improvement using the powerful Bates Method tools of relaxation, imagination, and awareness. You will learn key techniques, and how and why they work for reading glasses, nearsightedness, and many other conditions including cataract and glaucoma. The webinar is a video presentation and includes live questions. Learn where Dr. William H Bates was coming from, why his techniques are much more than eye exercises, and how EFT and other techniques compliment the Bates Method really well._

You can also download the entire original book if you look for it.

Everything he says in the video, and the book, makes 'sense', but that does not mean it actually works.  A lot of things make 'sense' that are not actually true.

It worth noting that the Bates Method was fairly trashed by another doctor in 1956 who claims that Bate's basic understanding of human anatomy was wrong.  You can read his entire book [here]( https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4399673;view=1up;seq=19)

### The YES Part

One study did indicate that the Bates method, while not necessarily improving eyesight, did improve the cognitive ability in the brain when it came to processing images.

Alternatively, a doctor in India claims that using three simple yogic 'asanas', or techniques has improved eyesight by one diopter in his studies on over 1000 students.

Interestingly, the three techniques of eye palming, solarization, blinking, and eye massage is similar to western techniques that claim eye improvement.

Beyond the validity of the Bates Method, or similar exercises and their claims, there are a number of eye problems that can be exacerbated, or created, by eye stress and misuse, and these issues do respond well to eye exercises.  Presumably, older folks, with their years of eye strain, will be more susceptible.

Computers, cell phones, etc, have lead to what is called "digital eye strain."  This especially affects people who work on computers all day long.  Symptoms fo digital eye strain are:

* Dry eyes
* Blurred vision
* Eye strain
* Headaches

Exercise can certainly help in this regard.

Certain eyes problems, such as convergence insufficiency (CI), strabismus,(cross-eyed or walleye), and amblyopia (lazy eye) can also benefit from exercises, but typically these problems also require medical supervision from an eye doctor.

In conclusions, If you take care of your eyes by not abusing them, overusing them, caring for them, which would include exercises, massage, etc., then the health of your eyes will benefit, and may, depending on your issues, show some improvement.  Even if they do not show improvement, certainly by just having healthier eyes you will most likely increase your chances of staving odd or exacerbating eye problems.  

**In short, there is no downside to caring for your eyes, and there might be an upside.**

Additional notes...

(taken directly from the University of Utah's "[5 Vision Myths Debunked](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2017/09/vision-myths.php)")

Some warnings about saving your eyesight have a lot of merit: wear sunglasses, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, don’t smoke, and when you’re working on a computer, give your eyes a rest every 20 minutes. Then there’s the timeless command from parents to kids: “If you’re not careful with those Nerf guns, someone’s going to lose an eye!” (It happens—hence, the very real need for protective eyewear).

On the other hand, it’s good to know there are some eye myths that, although they keep circulating, you can ignore. Such as. . .

**If you cross your eyes, they’ll stick that way.**
Nope. Our eye muscles are meant to allow us to move our eyes in all directions. Looking left or right, up or down, won’t force them to stay permanently in those positions, just as crossing the eyes won’t force them to stay that way. Crossed eyes may result from disease, uncorrected vision, or from muscle or nerve damage.

**Your vision will get worse if you read in dim light.**
It may be harder to read in dim light, but it won’t damage your eyes. For centuries people read and worked by candlelight or gas lamps—both situations that offered far less illumination than the electric lights we have today. However, having good light will prevent eye fatigue and make reading easier.

**Sitting too close to the TV or reading a book too close will ruin your eyes.**
Not true. Many children with excellent vision like to hold books very near to their eyes or sit close to the TV. Their youthful eyes focus very well up close, so it’s natural and safe for them. Children and adults who are nearsighted might need to get close to a book or television set to see clearly.

**Only boys are color blind.**
Color blindness, also known as color deficiency, occurs when you are unable to see colors in a certain way. Most commonly, color blindness happens when a person can’t distinguish between greens and reds, and occasionally blues. While males are much more likely to develop color blindness, it does also happen to females.

**Wearing glasses makes your eyes dependent on them.**
Eyeglasses correct blurry vision whether near or far. You may want to wear your glasses more often so that you can see clearly, but your glasses aren’t changing your eyes so that they become dependent on your eyeglasses. You’re just getting used to seeing things more clearly. Similarly, wearing glasses with the wrong prescription won’t ruin your eyes. You just won’t see as clearly as you would with the right prescription.
