# Microdosing and neuro enhancement
by Jeff Milton, ThirdAge.Life contributor

Microdosing is a potentially delicate subject, but it shouldn't be.  If you are unaware of what microdosing is, it is simply the ingestion of extremely small doses of psychotropic substances, such s psychedelic mushrooms, mescaline, LSD, etc.

The problem with the subject of microdosing is that it comes laden with a tone of historical baggage from the '60s and '70s.  Ironically, modern use of such substances rivals that of the '60s, but we are just not hearing about it as much.  This is mainly due to the fact that people are taking smaller doses than those of the past.

It's not unlike how we saw alcohol not so long ago.  The proponent fo prohibition has number examples of why alcohol should be outlawed, from its damaging effects on the family and society to its violation of God's will.  Today we know that alcohol in an appropriate amount can lower risk of cardiovascular disease, lengthen your life, improve your libido, help prevent the common cold, decrease changes of dementia, diabetes, and gallstones, to name a few.  

The lesson learned from alcohol, and this can apply to just about anything, is, where a small amount can be beneficial, too much can be dangerous.

For many people, especially those born in the '50s and '60s, LSD has a bad rap.  LSD had been in use since  the later 40's like a therapeutic drug with remarkable success, but the overuse and abuse during the American Cultural Revolution pretty much put the kibosh on any legitimate use for the next 40 years.

Professionals in the social sciences (such as M.A.P. S. [https://maps.org/](https://maps.org/)) have been discovering that microdoses of psychotropic substances are not only healthy for you, but it can also transform your life on many fronts.  

Of course, like many of the nootropics that we are 'discovering" today, psychotropics have been in use by cultures all over the world for many thousands of years.  

LSD, as a microdose, has become a legitimate nootropic drug, so much so that the first clinical trials of microdosing LSD were started last September 2018 [1]

Researcher have claimed that microdoses of LSD, amount so small they are barely perceptible, has had radically positive results as an anti-depressant, anti-anxiety[2], mood-enhancer, creativity enhancer, improves well-being, imp[roves productivity, improves athletic training, and a slew of other claims ranging from autism therapy to cancer patient rehabilitation  [3].  

Even as a macro-dosages, psychotropics have been shown to have a positive and persistent effect [4].  This is beyond the scope of this p[ost, but worth noting.

I have yet to find any research that specifically deals with issues that affect the elderly, but from personal experience, I can attest to microdosing's efficacy when it comes to mood, energy, motivation, awareness, stress, mental acuity and general peace of mind.

The BIG problem is LSD is currently illegal to buy, and psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline, and many other entheogenic plants are illegal to grow.  

Here are some videos worth watching if you have any interest in the subject.

#### _Microdosing: People who take LSD with breakfast - BBC News: Microdosing is when you take a tiny amount of psychedelic drugs - LSD or magic mushrooms usually - as part of your ordinary day. The drugs are illegal, and there is no medical evidence to say what the benefits or harms of it may be. But a small community of people in the UK are doing it anyway, and say it’s improving their lives. Some say it aids creativity and concentration and others argue it helps with their mental health problems. BBC Reporter Catrin Nye has been meeting the people that do it._

#### _Does microdosing LSD make you smarter? There's a growing trend in the US: raising brain performance by microdosing LSD. Many people now consume so-called neuroenhancers such as like ritalin, cannabis and cocaine. The substances give you a temporary high, but can also have side effects._

I had the pleasure of working with the quiet honorable and respectable Paul Austin (video below) on his site [https://thethirdwave.co](https://thethirdwave.co), which is probably the authoritative source for microdosing info.
