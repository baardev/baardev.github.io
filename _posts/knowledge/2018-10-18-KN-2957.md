intro: Third Agers on the Interweb's YouTubes.
---

Internet use in adults aged 65 to 74 has increased from 52% in 2011 to 80% percent in 2018, closing the gap on younger age groups.  In addition, YouTube reaches 95% of online adults aged over 55 in a month, and 75% percent of adults turn to YouTube for nostalgia rather than tutorials or current events.

So, why are there so few YouTube channels hosted by this demographic?  No doubt, this will change, but in the meantime, here are some of the channels by Third Agers that you might want to check out.
