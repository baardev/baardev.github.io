intro: Third Agers need a bugout bag more than any other demographic.
---

If you don't know what a "bugout bag" is you're not alone.,  If you do, the term probably conjures images of an Army M.A.S.H. unit near the front line who are making a quick exit, i.e "bugging out."

The term has been around in survival and preparation groups for a while as well. In short, a bugout bag is one bag you can grab and run immediately. There are a number of extreme examples of why might would need one, such as, a fire breaks out in your house, immanent floods, tornados, storms, earthquakes, or emergencies that call you away immediately.  It's never a bad idea to be prepared.

FEMA, The Federal Emergency Management branch of the U,.S government, has a number of public service videos on the how's and why's of what they call a "go bag".

Other people take their bugout bag pretty seriously.

And there are backpacks specifically designed to be bugout bags.

#### _ULTIMATE BUG OUT BAG? Assault Rush Pack Backpack Review BEST BOB FOR PRICE? Top Rated Hiking Budget: I was looking for the Ultimate BUG OUT BAG for under 200 bucks. I believe I have found it. I have yet to put this bag through the paces but from first inspection and hiking trip it appears to be top notch!_

These are pretty hardcore bags, and not really a 'grab and run' bag, at least for many third agers, as they weigh up to 100 Lbs.  These might be useful if you find yourself lost in the Amazon Basin or an Indonesian rainforest, but for more urban, less adventurous folks, something more reasonable might be one of the following:

### Urban Disaster and 3-Day Survival
This is a fairly heavy duty setup with food, supplies, medicine, etc. for 3 days in a post-apocalyptic, Mad Max sort of world.  A good list of contents can be found [here](https://www.primalsurvivor.net/urban-bug-out-bag/).

### Pre Disaster Bag
This is what you would grab before it hits the fan, so no need for water purification tablets, hydrant wrenches, lock picking set, etc...

This sort of bag would typically have the following:

* Legal Documents, such as passport, deeds, birth certificates, and other critical documents
* Food, like protein bars or nuts, enough to stave off hunger for a day.
* Medicines, both prescriptions, and general.  Ibuprofen, band-aids, hydrogen peroxide, antiseptics, latex gloves.  Typically, 30% of your bag would be just medical supplies.  You should also always make sure to have extra prescription medicines on hand.
* Tools.  Razor blade, utility knife, nylon string, duct take.
* Defense items, such as personal alarms, pepper spray. If you live in one of the fourteen 'Vermont Carry' states, and you have a gun, that should be included.

### Third Ager Considerations.

The most important point regarding bugout bags and third agers is that thirds agers have significantly less resilience, strength, and stamina to endure some sort of emergency or disaster, making them more vulnerable.  In fact, the feeling of vulnerability is one of the major liabilities for third agers in general, as it can also bring on a number of other debilitating psychological effects, such as depressions and apathy.

That said, everything mentioned your standard fare for your average person.  Older people have special needs that can be difficult to address once you are in the 'field'.  For example, medical supplies should include dressing for wounds and skin, as old people bruise very easily.  If someone in on blood thinners, that can be a real problem if there is serious bleeding.  As odd as it sounds, superglue is a great emergency medical supply.

Sunblock could be pretty important depending on where you are, especially for other folks whose skin is already susceptible to exposure.

Doctors in the U.S.  don't give out the old fashioned nitroglycerin pills used for people with artery and heart issues, at least that is what my U.S. doctor told me when I asked for them.  However, they work better in an emergency then anything else, which is why they are still handed out in other countries, such as Argentina, where people have even 20% more fatal heart attacks than they do in the U.S. (I guess it's all the great meat they have down there).  You can ask your doctor to get some for you.

Electric operated socks and gloves might be necessary if someone has circulation issues and will be exposed to the cold.  Aspirin (salicylic acid) is a natural blood thinner which helps with circulation and also helps keep your body cooler if you are in an especially hot location.

### "You Never Know" Bag
This is the bag I carry with me every time I leave the house, for any reason.  With this bag alone I can avoid certain disaster in case something happened while I was out that prevented me from returning home (it's happened to me, and it can happen to anyone).  Keep in mind, I am 63 years old, with 13 stents, a bad back, and skin cancer... so, not exactly a spring chicken.  There is plenty of room for more in the bag, and it weighs maybe a couple of pounds.

With this bag, I can be dropped in any virtually any city in the world without worrying if I am going to survive long enough to figure out what I need to do, but on a more practical day-to-day level, it has saved me countless times just in my own city (in New York City and Buenos Aires, Argentina). All th items in CAPS are those items I only carry now due to my age, as I would never have thought to include them just 10 years ago.  There are also a few things missing, now that I look at it, such as antiseptics, iodine (for disinfectant and water purification), needle and thread, earphones, pepper spray, personal alarm.

This is what is in my bag today...
