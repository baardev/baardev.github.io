Cold showers are one of the most beneficial health practices you can do.

Many of the problems I see people dealing with daily could be relieved, or at least mitigated, just by taking cold showers. Not only does it have a profound health effect, but it builds one's psyche, will, and determination.

It's no wonder that the children of Siberia are extraordinarily healthy, given they take cold, as in Siberian cold, showers daily. [Here](https://siberiantimes.com/healthandlifestyle/others/features/f0211-this-is-how-little-siberians-learn-to-love-our-trademark-cold-and-stay-healthy/) is an article from the Siberian Times, where they note teachers saying **"The children who do have the ice showers are also are more sensible, balanced - and optimistic. They are better organized."**

This is not surprising to me, just as it is not surprising how a life of "comfort" breads lazy, unhappy, less balanced, less optimistic, less organized people.

There are many videos on the benefits of cold showers.  I will post just a few here, but it's worth your while doing your own research.

**Follow-up**

Since making this video I have done some additional research regarding the carbon cycle and blood oxygenation.  I did this because it was not clear to me how hyperventilation could increase oxygen to the blood if the effect of hyperventilation was to increase the CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood, specifically when exposed to the cold.

The following is my understanding, with a bit of speculation at the end.  This may not be correct, so don't take this as actual medical information.  **If anyone has anything to constructively add to this, please let me know.**

Medical research shows quite clearly that hyperventilation decreases oxygen in the blood, so why then, does the body automatically begin hyperventilating when it is very cold.  The bodies reaction to exposure to cold is called the "cold shock response."  This is when the body automatically gasps for air when exposed to cold, usually followed by hyperventilation.

First, let's examine the role of carbon dioxide in the body.    CO<sub>2</sub> is produced by the cells in the body when they perform work.  The CO<sub>2</sub> then is absorbed into the bloodstream and when it gets to the lungs, it escaped from the blood and we exhale it.

When the CO<sub>2</sub> enters the blood, some of the CO<sub>2</sub> interacts with the water (H<sub>2</sub>O) in the blood to form carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), but carbonic acid is very unstable at body temperature, and it loses one of the hydrogens, which results in negatively charged molecule of bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>-) and an extra positively charged hydrogen (H+) just floating around freely.  

At any given point our blood has carbon dioxide, ionized bicarbonate and extra positively charge hydrogen in it, all at the same time.  This balance between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ion determines the pH of the blood, which is typically 7.4, slightly above the perfect balance of pure acid (pH=0) and pure alkaline (pH=14).

When we hyperventilate we are eliminating the CO<sub>2</sub> from our blood faster than normal.  Because of this lack of CO<sub>2</sub>, the carbonic acid in the blood changes back to water and carbon dioxide, which returns the body to the proper balance of bicarbonate ion and carbon dioxide.

However, this chemical reaction is slow compared to the speed at which CO<sub>2</sub> is being released from the body.  As a result, the surplus of extras positive hydrogen atoms bond with the bicarbonate, reducing the positive charge of the blood, which makes the blood more negatively charged, and therefore, more alkaline. This is called 'alkalosis', and typically goes away as soon as the carbonic acid breaks up again, restoring balance, and pH back to 7.4 (down from maybe 7.7 or so)

One of the reasons there is less apparent oxygen in the blood due to hyperventilation is not that is actually less oxygen, in fact, there IS more oxygen in the blood, but because the pH of blood is more alkaline, the positively charged oxygen molecules in the blood form a stronger bond to hemoglobin and stay there until the pH is restored.  As a result, the oxygen molecules never leave the bloodstream. A rise in pH of 0.3 (7.4 to 7.7) can cause 20% of the oxygen in the blood to not leave the bloodstream, hence, a 20% reduction in oxygen to the cells.

Another reason is due to the vasoconstriction of the blood vessels during hyperventilation.  This naturally reduces the volume of blood flow, and consequently the volume of oxygen being delivered.

Intuitively, this does not sound like a good thing.  In fact, there are cases of people dying from hyperventilation and doctors will strongly advise against hyperventilating.  Why then are there successful therapies that induce hyperventilation for 2 to 3 hours?  Wouldnt the lack of oxygen to the brain cause damage to cells and possibly the brain, perhaps permanently?  Apparently not, as can be seen in this study of 11,000 psychiatric inpatients.

But back to cold therapy breathing...

The breathing technique I used in the video is called the Wim Hof method, sometimes called tummo breathing as well, which is a form of kundalini yogic breathing.  This is hyperventilating for about a minute followed by no breathing for about 20 seconds.

In the first minute of hyperventilation, we are increasing our blood pH as well as reducing the oxygen delivered to the cells.  Then, in the second phase of not breathing, the body begins to pull oxygen out of blood while there is no new oxygen being introduced.  This will have the opposite effect of hyperventilation, i.e. reducing the pH of the blood, thereby releasing the bonded oxygen while at the same time creating a surplus of CO<sub>2</sub> that is not being released, resulting in water and CO<sub>2</sub> creating carbonic acid.

_I can only speculate on the following..._

When we begin to stop breathing after hyperventilation we have, for a short moment of time, a surplus of oxygen in the blood.  I said before that during hyperventilation there is a constriction of the blood vessels, and especially so if we are exposed to the cold which additionally constricts blood flow.  However, the reason the body constricts blood flow during the cold is to ensure the survival of the vital organs by keeping as much blood around them as possible. This blood will have extra oxygen in it at this point, and with the release of the adrenalin due to the cold exposure, the organ's higher metabolism will use that oxygenated blood much faster than normal, which will be very beneficial to the organs, presumably.

Perhaps the body hyperventilates when it is cold knowing it is building a reserve of oxygen in the bloodstream, and then when one stops hyperventilating (because it is actually difficult to maintain it for a long time) the blood releases that oxygen which will be used by the organs that are currently surrounded by blood.
