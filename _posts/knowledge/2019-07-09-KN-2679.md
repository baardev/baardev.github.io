intro: Ways to deal with sciatica and related pain.
---


40% of the population (in Western countries) suffer from sciatica.  Unfortunately, I am one of these statistics.  When my sciatica got was getting to the point where it was painful to do just about anything, obviously, I went to a doctor.  They worked on me for three or four months with physical therapy, and very limited results, and then concluded that I needed spinal surgery.  I was not happy about that but accepted their opinion if for no other reason that I just wanted the pain to end.  In addition, the inability to move was having lifestyle side effects that were not healthy.  

However, just before surgery, I had to go to South America.  I would not call where I was exactly"3rd world", but it was far from "1st world" when it came to medical care... it was more like triage.  Surgery was no longer an option.  I had to find a way to deal with this problem on my own with fairly limited resources.

The good news is, I have been somewhat successful, in that I have significantly less pain and more mobility.  The bad news is I want it to go away completely.  I had to start doing some real research on how to fix this problem.  In this article, I will share what little I have come to learn.  

I hope it helps you.

First off, let's look at exactly what sciatica is.

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYj-JfX0wT0" %}

In this video, they state that often sciatica will fix itself, but in my case, where it was by the trifecta of trauma, hernia, degenerative bone disease AND arthritis in my L4/L5 area, that was not likely, as it had been getting worse for a couple of years already.

OK, first things first.  The easiest things to 'fix' first may not heal the problem, but would slow its growth.  These are simple things like.

### Posture

This is most relevant for people who sit a lot, especially at work.  I added a post on posture [here](http://thirdage.life/index.php/knowledge/how-improve-posture-healthy-back).

### Eliminate back stress

Obviously, don't do anything that will stress the back.  In my case, being an avid tango dancer, that also meant not dancing people who don't have good balance.  It also meant, no heavy lifting, no carrying heavy objects like a backpack, no jarring the back with jumping, jogging, etc.

One of the best ways I found to eliminate spinal stress and pressure was to hang upside down.  I wrote a post about this [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /knowledge/2019-04-12-KN-337  %}), including a how-to video.  Check it out. My results were amazing!

### Reduce inflation

Short of talking tons of Ibuprofen, serrapeptase enzymes, or other drugs/supplements? what can be done to reduce inflammation?   Diet is one way.  There is a lot of info on diet and inflammation worth reading, but a super short synopsis from [Harvard Health](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation) is as follows.

Another very effective way to reduce inflammation, and you're really not going to like this, is ... freezing cold showers, or even better, a freezing cold bath!  It sounds terrifying to those who have never tried it and amazing to those who have.  As it related to sciatica, a cold bath reduces overall body inflammation but it has so many other amazing, almost miraculous, benefits, from hormones to immunology, that to not try it out makes no sense.   I have a how-to video on this [here](/mish{% post_url /knowledge/2019-01-15-KN-335  %}).

### Stretching

Daily stretching, preferably a few times during the day, has been very effective in receding pain and increasing mobility.  The worst time of the day is when I wake up.  My back and sciatic nerves are super tight so I spend a little more time, maybe 15-20 minutes, slowly stretching out.

These stretches cover sciatic issues as well as a number of others
Everything stated above is generally good for all sorts of issues, including sciatica, but It may be the case that you have lower lumbar/butt pain but it may not actually be sciatica.  There are a lot of nerves at the base of your spine and many things can go "wrong" and it could feel sciatica-ish and not actually be sciatica.

So, first do a test for sciatica, as shown here.

When I did this test I discovered I had less sciatica and more piriformis and perhaps spinal stenosis than I thought, but the stretching and exercises for healing all of those are similar.

### Mind/Body Approach

It is [well established](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4759289/) that stress can exacerbate, and in some cause be the cause of, back pain.  Few of us are stress-free, so, it would serve us well to reduce that stress, for our backs, as well as our general well-being.  Sometimes we need the pain to motivate us.  If you have the interest, you can read this study on stress and pain.  It refers to a number of different types of therapies, such as psychological interventions, psychotherapy, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), hypnosis-hypnotic therapies, mindfulness-based interventions, mirror therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and relaxation training technique.

I have not tried any of these, but I have been mindful to practice my exercises that do reduce stress and anxiety, which include types of meditations, breathing, and movement exercises.  It's hard to say how much of an effect they have had, but, there is no downside to doing them and numerous benefits.

However, just the other day I had a very interesting experience that demonstrated how back pain (at least mine) could be related to state of mind.  I ate something bad... not sure what, but it made me terribly ill.  I found myself vomiting violently over a toilet while experiencing a lot of pain in my abdomen.  In those minutes my mind was not concerned with anything except the hell I was going through.  When I finished vomiting I stood up and noticed I was pain-free!  Not just a little, but completely!  I moved and bent and twisted my body in all the ways I would not have dared to while experiencing back pain, and it was all pain-free.  The was truly shocking, to be pain-free after 3 to 4 years of non-stop pain.

I wondered what could account for this.  It came down to 1) something about vomiting adjusted my back or 2) the complete abandonment of whatever I was unconsciously stressing about during those moments I thought I was going to die in a toilet of vomit.  Perhaps my unconscious rearranged its priorities.  Over the next two days much of the pain returned, supporting the theory that either 1) whatever got shifted during my wretching slipped back in to its old positions or 2) by unconscious began to realize it was not facing a life-threatening situation and went to business-as-usual stressing on about whatever it loves to stress on about.

My investigation is ongoing!

Given the fairly recent discovery of how important our gut bacteria is to our mental and emotional health, the relationship between a bad state of mind, good diet, and back pain seem super obvious.   It may also be that back pain and stress are both consequences of the same bad diet.  In any case, eating well also has no downside.

### The Spiritual Perspective

The idea that physical pain is a part of spiritual evolution has been around for a long time.  Eckhart Tolle, a German-born spiritual teacher and author of "The Power of Now and A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose" states that "Pain is a necessary part of growth until you no longer need it".  He goes on to describe his idea of the "pain body."  He describes it as an accumulation of painful life experience that were not fully faced and accepted in the moment they arose, leaving behind an energy form of emotional pain. It comes together with other energy forms from other instances, and so after some years, you have a “pain body,” an energy entity consisting of old emotion, which will eventually manifest itself in the physical body as pain.

I can not say whether all this is true or not, but, as it creates a model through which we can eliminate old pains and their consequentially related physical pans, it's certainly worth considering.  On a personal note, I can safely say that the most painful times in my life, which includes physical pain, such as my various heart attacks, definitely altered my way of living, thinking and acting in a way that has been hugely beneficial.

If you think this has some credibility, or you want to hear more, look into such concepts as [pain body](https://www.newworldlibrary.com/Blog/tabid/767/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/438/DISSOLVING-THE-PAIN-BODY-An-excerpt-from-THE-POWER-OF-NOW-by-Eckhart-Tolle.aspx#.XYP64UGYVhE).

Even if you don't buy the idea of the "pain body" or that pain is nothing more than physical discomfort that has no connection with anything non-physical, it's safe to say that our way of living is inextricably bound to our physical existence, so anything we can do to improve our way of living will most likely have beneficial side-effects, and maybe even fix, among many other things,  back pain.
