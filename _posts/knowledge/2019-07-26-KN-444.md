## A Brief look at Ashwagandha  & Bacopa
by Jeff Milton, ThirdAge.Life editor

Bacopa use dates back to the 6th century A.D. and is mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts.  In one study published by the NIH, Bacoma was shown to have "immense potential in the amelioration of cognitive disorders and cognitive enhancement".  Look at this diagram of neurons before and after Bacopa.   In addition, it was also found to be anti-convulsant, anti-depressant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-ulcerogenic, anxiolytic, adaptogenic, anti-neoplastic, hepatoprotective and immunostimulatory.

But perhaps the most impressive finding was that the branching and length of dendrites in the part of the brain that deals with learning and memory (amygdala) showed significant growth under when the user (in this case, some lab rats) took Bacopa.  In this image below we can see the normal brain cell (A), and brain cells exposed to six weeks of Bacopa at doses of 20 mg/kg (B), 40 mg/kg (C), and 80 mg/kg (D).  You can see that (D) has over twice the number of dendrites that (A) has.

Wow!

However, increasing your brain's signal processing ability will not have much of an effect if your brain is filled with stress-induced chemicals like cortisol.  Stress has been shown to actually shrink dendrites and change the structure of the brain [4].  This not only nullifies the effect of the Bacopa, but might even enhance the stress-producing structures [6].  Having a high-performance, stressed-out brain is like having a Porsche 920 with flat tires.

But there's more bad news. The brain eats up 20% of the total calories burned in the body, and we know that thinking alone will reduce the glucose levels in the blood.  In fact, the brain's demand for "fuel" (glucose) is so great it will dilate blood vessels in areas where there is more activity in order to provide more sugar-fuel for thinking.  In short, the brain burns a lot of energy.  Stress, while reducing the signal processing ability of the brain (smaller, and less, dendrites), also increases signal generation, thereby demanding more fuel [5].  In other words, not only do you have a Porsche 920 with flat tires, you only have 1st gear, so your engine is racing, you're moving very slow, and you're destroying your beautiful Porsche, all because of stress.

This is where Ashwagandha comes in. This amazing plant has been reported to have been in use 2,000 years ago and is spoken of in the Ayurvedic texts, some of which date back 6,000 years.

Modern research has shown Ashwagandha to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-stress, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, hemopoietic, and rejuvenating properties.  According to one research study in the  Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, published by the U.S. National Institute of Health, Ashwagandha root extract was shown to have adaptogen properties that improve resistance to, and ability to handle, stress.  

This is why Bacopa and Ashwagandha make such an effective pair... one ramps up the brain power, and the other helps that brain power get put to constructive and efficient use.

Some people report that this combo causes them to feel too relaxed, too "chill".  This is sometimes remedied by adding a little stimulant to the mix, such as caffeine.  Other people report being too stimulated, in which case they might add a bit of Gotu Kola.  Ingredients can be added as your needs demand.

For example, a recommended "Nootropic Stack" for boosting your brain, lifting your mood and enhancing your memory is the following:

* 1 g Fish Oil
* Multivitamin
* 300 mg Alpha GPC
* 300 mg NALT
* 200 mg Caffeine
* 200 mg L-Theanine
* 500 mg Lionâ€™s Mane Mushroom
* 300 mg Bacopa Monnieri
* 300 mg Ashwagandha

Add the following as needed for an immediate cognitive boost

* 200 mcg Huperzine A
* 20 mg Vinpocetine

Add the following as needed for fighting fatigue and to combat stress

* 500 mg Rhodiola Rosea (morning only)

There is a lot of information on the benefits and usage of nootropics.  I recommend checking out the Reddit discussion group on the subject at https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/
