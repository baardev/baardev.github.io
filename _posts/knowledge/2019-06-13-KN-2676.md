The good news is that the elderly tend to be less a target of crime, although this general statistic is misleading because most of the crime against elderly occur in urban areas, especially poor areas, at a rate up to three times greater than younger demographics [3].  The bad news is that this good news is becoming a thing of the past as crimes against the elderly has been growing [4].  The other bad news is that because the elderly are significantly more vulnerable they tend to suffer from a state of fear which can have dire psychological consequences.

Oddly, the fraud committed against the elderly is staggering at about $37 billion a year!  One of the few benefits of age is, supposedly, wisdom...  but statistics would appear to argue otherwise.

Regardless of age, It's remarkable how much we can do to increase our personal safety, and yet choose not too.

On one side of the spectrum, there is the handgun option.  If you live in one of the 16 states in the United States that allow "Constitutional Carry", you can just buy a handgun as no permit at all is required to carry a concealed weapon[1].  

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-01.jpg" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>This may sound a bit extreme, but when my 75-year-old mother moved to San Antonio, Texas, a city that has a terrible criminal record where your chances of being a victim are 1 in 50, she felt she had to buy a gun.  Not surprisingly, there is an entire line of small handguns made just for woman.  Both she and I slept better at night.

She felt a handgun was the only reasonable option as whistles and pepper spray required too much coordination and speed for her to made in the moment of a crisis.  Certainly, a physical defense was out of the question for a frail, asthmatic old lady.

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-02.png" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>This next option, using a CO2 pellet gun (like the one in the image), is controversial. On the downside, using a CO2 pellet gun for self-defense is ill-advised by many security experts mainly because it does not really have real stopping power, and if the other person has a real gun, well, you don't want to bring a pea-shooter to a gunfight.  On the other hand,  Shooting someone with a pellet gun can cause real, painful, damage, and can be very effective if you know how to use one, where to shoot, and under what circumstances it is an advantage.

But there is another, often hidden, but huge advantage to garnishing a pellet gun.  According to a research report printed in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminality, "Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun"[5]...

"Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their guns or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers."

(By overwhelming they mean around 92%) Simply put, if an attacker sees what looks exactly like a Baretta 9mm or a .38 revolver, the odds are greatly in your favor that the attacker is not going stick around.  Remember, an attacker just wants to get something from you, easily.  He is not going to risk his life for it.  Of course, you can't fire off a warning shot, but neither can you fire a warning shot with a real gun if you live in any city, as it is illegal.  So a real .357 Magnum and a pellet gun that looks like a real .357 Magnum have the same psychological deterring effect, which is significant.  But in the event that this does not deter your, attacker, a pellet from a pellet gun can penetrate an inch or more into a human body, so, it's definitely not pointless to use it if you have to.

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-03.jpg" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>Another less lethal option is a taser.  Often times the word "taser" and "stun gun" and used interchangeably, but there is a huge difference.  Tasers shoot out two electrodes that penetrate a person's body and then an electrical charge is sent through the attacker's body causing uncontrollable, involuntary, convulsions and spasms.  A "Stun gun" simply hurts like hell (as in unbearable pain) when you manually press it against a attackers body.  Hitting someone with a taser will, 99% of the time, incapacitate them for 15 seconds or so, giving you ample time to escape, or prepare for whatever you need to do next.  The problem with tasers is you only have one shot, so if you miss, you're in even deeper trouble.

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-04.jpg" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>Still, stun guns can be a useful addition to a self-defense arsenal, especially when used with something like pepper spray. [2].  There are a number of good products out there today, but they do require a little practice in how to use them effectively.  It would also be wise to have a simple 'rape whistle' or personal alarm, but a whistle or alarm alone is discouraged according to Using an alarm alone is not recommended, according to [AWARE.ORG](http://aware.org/), an anti-rape site.  [It's worth reading](http://aware.org/alarms-whistles-2).

According to England's NHS (National Health Service), where 33% of their nurses have been violently attacked, they state  

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-05.jpg" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>_"Simple audible alarm devices are not based on the expectation that they will produce assistance from third parties. Rather, they are primarily intended to create a distraction to allow the worker time to get away from a potentially violent situation."  --NHS_

But if you're not nimble enough to dash from the crime, or there is nowhere to dash to, you will need to use that moment of distraction to, say, use your pepper spray or stun gun.  It would be wise to practice how to use alarms and sprays/guns together before you need to.

<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-2676-insert-06.jpg" style="margin:15px;border:1px solid grey;width:25%;float:left"/>Not really a review, more like an unboxing and demo. Impressive. At the other end of the spectrum, we are left with only hand-to-hand defense.  This is probably ill-advised unless you're faced with an extreme situation.  Hand-to-hand combat is dangerous and requires the most practice, and given the average attack lasts only 9 seconds, whatever you are going to do, you need to do it fast and it has to be effective.

There are a lot of self-defense videos out there, but unless you are in decent shape, fearless, and have some training, these will be relatively useless.  The most effective move you can make is simply poking them in the eyes, and use the few seconds that gives you kick them in the groin, then run.

Given my own personal circumstance and where I live, the most reasonable and effective approach is the alarm followed by pepper spray/stun gun, followed by escape.   Your mileage may vary.
