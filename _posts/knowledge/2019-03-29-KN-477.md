intro: Information about drinking tea as a sleep aid.

<SUP>This article was taken directly from [Tuck.com](https://www.tuck.com/teas-improve-sleep/)</SUP>

Tea is the most [popular beverage worldwide](http://www.teausa.com/14655/tea-fact-sheet) after water. In the United States alone, 80 percent of people drink tea, and 50 percent do so on a daily basis.

Americans love their tea. It offers [similar boosts in alertness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130000383) to coffee, but with less caffeine, so it interferes less with sleep and can be enjoyed later in the day than the typical 2pm cutting off point for coffee drinkers.

But can tea actually help you sleep? Do so-called “bedtime” and “sleepytime” teas really work? Keep reading to find out.

## QUICK SUMMARY
**Sleepytime** and **bedtime teas** are caffeine-free, herbal teas made of many of the same materials that are found in sleep supplements. It’s not the tea, but rather the ingredients, that help you sleep. Although, tea is often a much more pleasant way of ingesting these ingredients, and can be a calming activity in and of itself.

By combining multiple pro-sleep, anti-anxiety herbal ingredients, bedtime teas create an overall calming bedtime experience that promotes sleepiness at the same time. Some sleepytime tea ingredients have a sedative effect, like chamomile or valerian, while others, like lavender and lemon balm, reduce the stress and anxiety that plague insomniacs. Still others, like spearmint, alleviate indigestion so the body can relax for sleep.

### Do bedtime teas really work?
Drinking tea before bed soothes many people. There is a calming aspect to sipping a warm liquid in your favorite mug before nodding off. It may mimic the effect of [taking a warm bath before bed](https://www.tuck.com/thermoregulation/). Even though the bath or tea water is hot, it ends up cooling you down. As your body dries off and the extra water evaporates from your skin, the corresponding drop in body temperature signals to your brain that it’s time for sleep.

Of course, caffeinated teas, such as black tea, white tea, and caffeinated green tea, should be avoided late at night, but there is some evidence that drinking certain herbal teas before bed can help facilitate sleep.

Sleepytime and bedtime teas are caffeine-free, herbal teas made of many of the same materials that are found in sleep supplements, including valerian root. It’s not the tea, but rather the ingredients, that help you sleep. Although, tea is often a much more pleasant way of ingesting these ingredients, and can be a calming activity in and of itself. For instance, ingredients like valerian root are quite stinky when taken alone, and taking a supplement with a quick swig of water is not nearly as relaxing an experience as drinking a full cup of warm tea.

By combining multiple pro-sleep, anti-anxiety herbal ingredients, bedtime teas create an overall calming bedtime experience that promotes sleepiness at the same time. Some sleepytime tea ingredients have a sedative effect, like chamomile or valerian, while others, like lavender and lemon balm, reduce the stress and anxiety that plague insomniacs. Still others, like catnip in the mint family, alleviate indigestion so the body can relax for sleep.

While many of these teas have a mild effect, if any at all, the placebo effect of knowing it’s a sleepytime tea may be enough to get you to fall asleep. As with most things, your reaction to the tea will depend on your personal sleep issues and taste preferences, and even what else you ate or did that day.

## Best teas for sleep
Below we review the best tea ingredients for sleep. You’ll find many bedtime teas actually contain multiple of these ingredients.
<div style="clear:both"></div>

### Chamomile tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-01.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Chamomile is oft cited as the best tea for sleep. The perennially popular herbal tea has been used for centuries to stave off insomnia, stress, anxiety, and upset stomachs. Chamomile has positive effects on individuals with mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder, and it also has antidepressant qualities. The tea works as a mild tranquilizer, relaxing the nerves and muscles.

Multiple small studies have found chamomile to provide various benefits, although the results are still inconclusive regarding sleep. One 2011 study split individuals with insomnia into two groups: one group took a placebo while the other took a chamomile extract twice a day for four weeks. While the chamomile had no effect on sleep onset, quality, or overall length, it did show some improvement in daytime functioning. However, a 2005 study of rats found chamomile extract helped them fall asleep much quicker.  In addition, another 2010 study suggests that chamomile tea could also have benefits in the following area:

* Anti-inflammatory and antiphlogistic properties
* Anticancer activity
* Help in relief of common cold
* Beneficial to Cardiovascular conditions
* Colic/Diarrhea conditions
* Eczema
* Gastrointestinal conditions
* Hemorrhoids
* Inflammatory conditions
* Mucositis
* Osteoporosis
* Anxiety and seizure
* Diabetes
* Sore throat/hoarseness
* Vaginitis
* Wound healing

(see report at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995283/)

Nevertheless, chamomile does contain the amino acid glycine, which acts as a nerve relaxant and mild sedative.

Chamomile can induce an allergic reaction and should be avoided by pregnant women or anyone about to have surgery due to its blood-thinning properties. For best results, steep this sweet and flowery tea for 10 minutes before drinking.

### Valerian tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-02.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
While chamomile is the most popular tea for sleep, there’s a stronger option preferred by those who really need help falling asleep: valerian tea.

Unlike chamomile, studies have proven moderate improvement of insomnia symptoms in drinkers of valerian tea.

As a strong natural sedative, valerian root has been used since the second century to help people fall asleep faster, reduce symptoms of insomnia and anxiety, and increase overall sleep quality. It works so well, that some people use it instead of melatonin supplements. Plus, valerian tea helps sleep without causing many of the side effects associated with other common sleep medications.

However, valerian root can become psychologically (not physically) addictive, cause agitation with long term continual long term use or interfere with other medications, so check with your doctor before taking it. Valerian also takes a few days to a few weeks for the effect to kick in. For best results, steep for at least 5 minutes before drinking.

### Decaf green tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-03.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Green tea is always a healthy option and serves as a nice bedtime tea alternative for those who don’t like the taste of herbal teas.

The decaf version includes theanine, which reduces stress and improves sleep. A sponsored study of young men in their 20s found that those who took a pure L-theanine supplement before bed enjoyed better sleep efficiency and a more energized mental state upon waking. However, a cup of tea doesn’t really have sufficient amounts of theanine to get you to fall asleep, so individuals really having trouble sleeping might want to get a pure L-theanine supplement instead.

Other benefits to green tea include potential weight loss, increased cognitive performance, deeper sleep, better digestion, and reduced cancer and diabetes risk.

### Lavender tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-04.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Lavender reduces stress and anxiety, which comprise many of the thoughts that keep insomniacs up at night.It may be the smell of lavender that promotes sleep, rather than ingesting it: a 2005 study found that smelling lavender oil before bed increased the time spent in deep sleep, and resulted in corresponding feelings of restoration and higher energy levels the following morning.

Lavender tea may have stronger effects for women. In one study of new postnatal mothers, the participants who drank one cup of lavender tea for two weeks had lower rates of depression and fatigue, an effect which went away when they stopped having the tea.

### Lemon balm tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-05.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
As far back as the Middle Ages, insomniacs have been relying on this calming herb to reduce stress, anxiety, and indigestion. As a member of the mint family, lemon balm has a minty yet lemony taste. There are lemon balm teas available, or you can steep lemon balm leaves in a cup of hot water.

For best results reducing insomnia, lemon balm should be combined with other herbs. In one study, 81 percent of participants with mild sleep issues slept better with a combo of lemon balm and valerian than those who took a placebo. Lemon balm may interact with the GABA receptors in your brain, the activation of which reduces stress and helps induce sleep.

### Passionflower tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-06.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Passionflower tea is beloved by people with anxious and obsessive thoughts. The floral tea calms the mind as well as the stomach since it also alleviates indigestion.

Passionflower relaxes the nervous system, and a 2011 study found that it at least improves sleep quality in the short-term.

Passionflower is a plant native to South America which is used as a relaxant and anxiolytic. If you’re trying to increase vivid dreams, passionflower can have a synergistic effect when brewed in combination with other relaxing herbs. An infusion of passionflower with St. John’s Wort, hops and valerian root produces a very calming herbal tea for sleeping that’s also quite tasty. People who do dream work often use passionflower as a potentiator for other herbs with specific calming or dream-promoting effects. I like to buy passionflower in dried form, as it’s perfect for brewing a tea to sleep well and encourage dreams.

### Hops
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-07.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Another herb to help you sleep is hops, a mild sedative herb which you might recognize as the main ingredient in beer. While I don’t recommend drinking a beer before bed (alcohol can make you drowsy, but it ultimately leads to poorer quality sleep), hops brewed in a sleep tea with other rest-promoting herbs can have a noticeable sedative effect for people seeking quicker onset of sleep.
<div style="clear:both"></div>

### St. John’s Wort tea
<img src="assets/images/posts/knowledge/KN-477-insert-08.jpg" style="width:25%;float:left"/>
Commonly used to treat depression, St. John’s Wort can help insomniacs who also have comorbid depression. Like lemon balm, researchers believe it stimulates the GABA receptors, which kickstarts the sleep process.  However, it is a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor but this MAOI also allows certain less-than-idea molecules pass the blood-brain-barrier, so foods that are high in tyramine (one of those less-than-ideal molecuies) should me avoided, such as: air dried meats, aged or fermented meats, sausage or salami, pickled herring, and any spoiled or improperly stored beef, poultry, fish, or liver, red wine, beer from a tap, beer that has not been pasteurize, aged cheeses, including blue, brick, brie, cheddar, parmesan, romano, and swiss, sauerkraut, over the counter supplements or cough and cold medicines that contain tyramine, soy beans, soy sauce, tofu, miso soup, bean curd, fava beans, or yeast extracts (such as Marmite). Caffeine intake should be limited as well. You should avoid or limit the use of alcohol while being treated with St. John's wort. Alcohol can increase the nervous system side effects of St. John's wort such as dizziness, drowsiness, and difficulty concentrating. Some people may also experience impairment in thinking and judgment.

### Catnip tea
While it makes cats go crazy, catnip tea reduces insomnia for humans by inducing drowsiness. Tea-drinking cat lovers can bond over the shared interest with their feline companions.

### Spearmint tea
This anti-inflammatory is often added to sleep teas purely for flavor purposes, but it also soothes indigestion and headache that may cause insomnia.

### Magnolia bark tea
Magnolia bark has been used in Asia for centuries to calm anxiety and nerves. The active compound magnolol acts as a mild sedative.

### Linden leaf or tilia tea
While typically used as a remedy for the common cold, the tilia flowers of the linden tree is calming herb is another mild sedative.

### Kava kava
Kava kava may be the best plant medicine for quieting that inner voice that keeps us awake at night, and thus among the best tea that helps you sleep. The kavalactones in this herb promote calm, ease stress, and work to promote deep sleep, which can be useful for people with disrupted or low quality sleep. Kava kava’s calming qualities also help reduce anxiety and can cut down on the duration and intensity of mild panic attacks. If you’re interested in trying out kava’s stress-busting abilities for yourself, it is possible to obtain kava kava in many different forms, from the whole dried root to instant drink mixes and capsules. Try taking kava about 30-60 minutes before bed to get the most out of kava’s sleep-inducing powers.

### Calea zacatechichi, Silene capensis
Two of my personal favorite dream herbs are Calea zacatechichi (called by many the original “dream herb”) and Silene capensis, or African Dream Root. In dried form, both of these dream herbs can be prepared as a tea. African Dream Root may be prepared and drunk either in the morning (at a ratio of ½ teaspoon steeped in ½ cup of water) or evening (1 tablespoon in 2 cups of water). While Silene capensis has almost no effect on you while you are awake after you fall asleep it encourages vivid dreams and increases your chances of becoming lucid in the dream state.

Calea zacatechichi can be infused into a tea or smoked shortly before bed to induce lucid dreams. Many dream workers take both preparations in combination to increase the potency of this powerful dream herb, though you might prefer trying them in a tea first, as smoking Calea can be a bit heavy on the lungs. For maximum effect, we recommend setting your alarm to go off 4-5 hours after you fall asleep and drinking Calea tea when you wake up, to coincide with your longest period of REM sleep! This really does work! Drink this infusion slowly with a bit of natural sweetener to help disguise the bitter taste of Calea zacatechichi, and with luck, you’ll be on your way to a memorable lucid dream!

Although all of the dreaming herbs discussed here have somewhat different effects, they can all be made into a lovely and calming tea to sleep that will bring you good, calming rest and vivid or even lucid dreams without any of the nasty side effects of pharmaceutical medicines. Try a few of the above-mentioned herbs, and you are sure to find the herbal teas for sleeping that provide you with just the effects you desire!
