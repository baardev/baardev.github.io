intro: A gentle system for reducing pain, increasing range of motion and improving balance.

The Feldenkrais Method (FM) is a very gentle and slow form of body movements designed to retrain how we move, on both a mindful and neurological level.

Although the FM is most commonly practiced by younger people, It has been increasingly adopted by the Third Age community because of its gentle approach and significant benefits.  

The way it is described on the website home is:

>The Feldenkrais Method® is a powerful and revolutionary approach to improving your life that uses gentle, mindful movement to bring new awareness and possibility into every aspect of your life. Developed by Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, the Feldenkrais Method has helped millions of people worldwide.

> https://feldenkrais.com/

The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to "rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement" and that "These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life".

The method itself was developers by Isreali scientist/martial artist Moshé Feldenkrais as a way to overcome a sports and military service sustained knee injury.

This description alone does not do the FM justice, because it really has to do with how we not only use our body and why we choose to use it that way in the first place, which is really an issue of psychology, habit, and lack of awareness.

You can see how gentle and smooth it is in this video.

#### _This is the first of 4 short films made by Andrew Dawson for the Feldenkrais Guild UK to promote awareness of the Feldenkrais Method. This first film focuses on a group awareness through movement (ATM) lesson. Here you can see how a personal FM therapy works._

### Studies

FM has attracted the attention of researchers, and there have been some studies done on its efficacy.  In one study, "The Effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method: A Systematic Review of the Evidence" they found significant improvements in:

- Greater neck flexion and comfort
- Reduced neck pain
- Reduced upper torso/limb discomfort
- Improved balance in people with MS
- Improved body image
- Reduction in teeth grinding during sleep in children
- Improved dexterity

In a study specifically for Third Agers, "Feldenkrais Movement Lessons Improve Older Adults’ Awareness, Comfort, and Function", they concluded that"

>"Older adults generally reported greater ease, comfort, balance, and mobility following this Feldenkrais lesson series. Those taking more lessons reached [better test results], and showed improved OPTIMAL scores indicating greater ease in a range of everyday movements"
