If you have to fight, having 19,000,000 volts on your side is a big advantage, </P>

The average attack lasts about 9 seconds.  That doesn't leave you much time to figure out how to respond, and if you do decide to respond, you better damn well be up to the task.  Short of carrying a gun, a stun gun is probably the most effective close range defense weapon you can have.  </P>
